Likely shares logical or functional dependencies.  \n- **Ability (0.368)**: High confidence score, suggesting tight integration or shared use cases with `Modifier.java`.  \n- **FoundingFather (0.315), UnitType (0.315), BuildingType (0.315)**: Moderate to high confidence; often involved in similar change events as `Modifier.java`.  \n- **FreeColGameObjectType (0.263), ModifierTest (0.263), FoundingFatherTest (0.263)**: Medium confidence; used in related contexts or test scenarios.  \n- **WorkProductionPanel (0.210), FeatureContainer (0.210), NationType (0.210), Colony (0.210)**: Indicative of moderate coupling, likely due to shared domain logic or UI interaction.  \n- **Scope (0.157), Tile (0.157), BuildingTest (0.157), ColonyTile (0.157), TileImprovementType (0.157)**: Lower confidence but still significant due to repeated co-change history.  \n- **FreeColTestCase (0.052), Specification (0.052), AbstractGoods (0.052), AIGoods (0.052), EquipmentType (0.052), BuildableType (0.052), ResourceType (0.052), AbstractUnit (0.052), SettlementType (0.052), Settlement (0.052), Player (0.052), ColopediaPanel (0.052), TileType (0.052), InGameController (0.052), InGameInputHandler (0.052), UnitContainer (0.052), FreeColDialog (0.052), SimpleCombatModel (0.052), FreeColObject (0.052), IndianNationType (0.105), EuropeanNationType (0.105)**: Though their confidence is low, they appear in the co-change data and may be relevant depending on the scope of the modification.

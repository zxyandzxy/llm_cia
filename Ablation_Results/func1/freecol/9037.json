This likely means these two files share tightly coupled functionality.\n\n2. **Strong Co-Change Relationships (Confidence \u2265 0.8):**\n   - `AbstractOption`\n   - `RangeOptionUI`\n   - `BooleanOptionUI`\n   - `AudioMixerOptionUI`\n   - `LanguageOptionUI`\n   - `FileOptionUI`\n   - `IntegerOptionUI`\n   - `PercentageOptionUI`\n   - `OptionGroupUI`\n\n   These entities show high confidence and support values, indicating they are often changed alongside `Option.java`. They seem to be closely related, possibly forming part of the same functional group or module, such as UI components and implementations for different types of options.\n\n3. **Moderate Co-Change Relationships (Confidence around 0.6 to 0.4):**\n   - `Messages`, `GameOptionsDialog`, `FreeColAction`, `FreeColActionUI`, `ListOptionUI`, `StringOptionUI`, etc.\n   These entities indicate moderate coupling with `Option.java`.\n\nTo further analyze which entities need synchronization, I will examine the call graph of `Option.java` to understand its direct dependencies within the system.

Among these, entities with high confidence and support values (e.g., **FreeColServer**, **InGameController**, **ServerGame**) are still strong candidates for synchronization due to their frequent historical co-modifications with `Game.java`.\n\nTo refine our selection further, let's check the conceptual coupling between `Game.java` and a few of the top candidates (like **FreeColServer** and **InGameController**) to determine if there's any semantic similarity that might justify synchronization.

Several entities share a confidence score of 0.222, indicating moderate historical co-change frequency.\n3. Many files only had one co-change instance with `OConsts.java`, resulting in lower confidence.\n\nNext steps:\n- To determine which of these files are truly impacted by changes in `OConsts.java`, we can analyze their conceptual coupling to assess semantic similarity.\n- Alternatively, we can examine call graph dependencies from `OConsts.java` to identify direct runtime interactions.\n\nWould you like to proceed with analyzing the **call graph** or checking the **conceptual coupling** with any specific file?",

These are strong candidates for synchronization consideration.\n  \n- On the other hand, most of the entities in the list have a support count of \"1\" and a low confidence value (e.g., 0.125), which indicates weaker historical coupling.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **Prioritize High-Support Entities**: We should focus on entities with higher support and confidence values first, as they are more likely to be impacted by or related to changes in `MMainWindow.java`.\n   \n2. **Analyze Dependencies**: To confirm whether these relationships indicate actual dependencies, we can use the `get_call_graph` function on `MMainWindow.java` to identify direct code-level dependencies.\n\nWould you like me to proceed with analyzing the call graph for `MMainWindow.java`?",

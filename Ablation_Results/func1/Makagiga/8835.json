Please note that in order to ensure recall, you need to give as many entities as possible (preferably more than 40) that need to be modified synchronously based on your analysis, where the result of the function get_co_change_relationship should be used as an important reference.

It also appears in the call graph of `OpenSearchDescription.java`, indicating a direct dependency. Moreover, conceptual coupling between these two files is relatively high (0.71), suggesting strong semantic similarity and functional interdependence.\n\n- **InternetSearchPlugin**: Co-changed with `OpenSearchDescription.java` (support = 1, confidence = 0.5). Given their shared context in search-related functionality, changes in one may ripple to this plugin class.\n\n- **InternetSearchPanel**: Also co-changed with `OpenSearchDescription.java` (support = 1, confidence = 0.5). As a UI component likely relying on search description data, it may need synchronization for consistency.\n\n- **TestOpenSearchDescription**: A test file that has been co-changed with `OpenSearchDescription.java` (support = 1, confidence = 0.5). Changes in implementation often require updates to corresponding test cases to ensure correctness.\n\nGiven the available data and CIA best practices, these entities should be considered for synchronized modification. Due to limited data recall from the functions provided, we are restricted to the above four entities, which are most relevant based on co-change history, dependency structure, and semantic coupling.",

This suggests that even though they may not have a direct call relationship, they likely share similar functionalities or responsibilities within the system.\n\nGiven this high conceptual coupling and the strong co-change history (`MLoginPanel` had 4 supports with 0.5 confidence), it's reasonable to conclude that `MLoginPanel.java` should be synchronized with changes made to `FormPanel.java`.\n\nIf you'd like to continue analyzing other co-changed entities (e.g., `TextEditor`, `ImportExport`) for conceptual coupling, please let me know. Otherwise, we can finalize our findings here.",

Any change in `FormPanel.java` has a high chance of impacting `MLoginPanel.java`, so this should be considered a top candidate for synchronization.\n\n2. **TextEditor.java, ShowHTMLAction.java, ImportExport.java**:\n   - Support: 2 changes each\n   - Confidence: 25% each\n   - Analysis: These files also show moderate coupling with `FormPanel.java`. While not as strongly connected as `MLoginPanel.java`, they still warrant attention as changes here might ripple into these files.\n\n### Low-Support Co-Changes:\n3. **Others (e.g., MMessage.java, LinkEditor.java, Slideshow.java, etc.)**:\n   - Support: 1 change each\n   - Confidence: 12.5% each\n   - Analysis: These files demonstrate weaker connections to `FormPanel.java`. They may require review depending on specific circumstances or criticality, but their likelihood of being impacted is low compared to the others.\n\n### Next Steps:\nTo further refine our understanding and identify which entities truly need synchronization, we can consider analyzing the call graph from `FormPanel.java` using the `get_call_graph` function.

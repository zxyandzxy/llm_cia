Entities like `EditServlet`, `UploadServlet`, `MoveServlet`, `RecentChange`, and `PersistencyHandler` have high confidence values (0.357 and 0.285), suggesting strong co-change relationships.\n2. These entities may need synchronization due to their historical coupling.\n\n### Next Steps:\nTo further narrow down which entities truly require synchronization, I will analyze the conceptual coupling between `TopicVersion.java` and these highly correlated entities using semantic similarity analysis.

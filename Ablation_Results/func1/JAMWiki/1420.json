These entities are likely tightly coupled to `LinkTag.java`, and synchronizing changes with them is highly recommended.\n\n2. **Moderate Confidence Co-changes (Confidence between 0.5 and less than 1.0):**\n   - `TextTag.java`, `WatchlistTag.java`, and `PaginationTag.java` have a confidence of 0.6667. They are moderately correlated with `LinkTag.java` and may share some dependencies or functionalities.\n   - It would be prudent to investigate these files further to determine if synchronization is necessary.\n\n3. **Low Confidence Co-changes (Confidence < 0.5):**\n   - Entities like `RadioTag.java`, `CheckboxTag.java`, `AlternateTag.java`, `AbstractButtonTag.java`, `AuthMsgTag.java`, `DecodeTag.java`, and `EncodeTag.java` have low confidence values (around 0.3333). This indicates a weaker historical correlation in modifications.\n   - While these files might not require immediate synchronization, their relevance should be reviewed based on functional or conceptual coupling.\n\n### Next Steps:\nTo refine the list of entities that need synchronization, we can explore additional perspectives:\n- Analyze semantic similarity using `get_conceptual_coupling` for moderate and borderline cases like `TextTag.java` or `WatchlistTag.java`.\n- Examine direct code-level dependencies using `get_call_graph` for `LinkTag.java`.\n\nWould you like to proceed with one of these steps?

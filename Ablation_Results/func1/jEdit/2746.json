They should be prioritized for further analysis to determine if synchronization is required.\n\n2. **Medium Confidence Entities**:\n   - Others like `TextUtilities`, `TokenMarker`, `BufferPrintable`, etc., have lower confidence scores (e.g., 0.25), but may still be relevant depending on the nature of the change.\n\nTo proceed effectively, we can analyze the call graph of `Chunk.java` to understand its direct dependencies. This will help us identify which of the co-changed entities are actually used by `Chunk.java` and therefore more likely to be impacted. Let's start with the highest-confidence entity, `JEditTextArea`, and examine its conceptual coupling with `Chunk.java`.\n\nI'll first retrieve the call graph information for `Chunk.java`.\n",

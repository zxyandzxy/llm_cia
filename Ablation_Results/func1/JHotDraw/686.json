The list shows several entities that have historically been modified together with `BezierPath.java`. Here are some key observations:\n\n- **SVGPathFigure.java** has the highest confidence (0.6) with 3 supports, indicating a strong historical correlation of changes between this entity and `BezierPath.java`.\n- **BezierFigure.java** and **BezierDemo.java** follow with a confidence of 0.4 each, suggesting they may also be relevant.\n- The rest of the entities have relatively lower confidence values (0.2), meaning the changes in these files are less consistently associated with changes in `BezierPath.java`.\n\nTo narrow down the list of entities that might need synchronization, we can focus on those with higher confidence scores (e.g., >= 0.4). Next, I will analyze the conceptual coupling between `BezierPath.java` and the top candidates (`SVGPathFigure.java`, `BezierFigure.java`, and `BezierDemo.java`) to determine semantic similarity. This will help identify which files are most likely to require synchronized changes.\n\nI will start by analyzing the conceptual coupling between `BezierPath.java` and `SVGPathFigure.java`.\n\n",

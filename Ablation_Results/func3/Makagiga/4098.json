Based on the results, several entities are frequently modified together with `SummaryData.java`. The confidence score and support count indicate how often these entities were modified alongside `SummaryData.java` in the past.\n\nHere is an interpretation of the results:\n\n1. **High Confidence Relationships**:\n   - `SummaryPanel`: Modified along with `SummaryData.java` 8 times, with a confidence of ~30.77%.\n   - `Reminder`: Modified along with `SummaryData.java` 8 times, with a confidence of ~30.77%.\n   - `SummaryTree`: Modified along with `SummaryData.java` 6 times, with a confidence of ~23.08%.\n   - `Action`: Modified along with `SummaryData.java` 5 times, with a confidence of ~19.23%.\n\nThese entities (`SummaryPanel`, `Reminder`, `SummaryTree`, and `Action`) have relatively high confidence scores compared to others, suggesting a strong relationship with `SummaryData.java`. Changes in `SummaryData.java` may likely impact or require updates in these files.\n\n2. **Moderate Confidence Relationships**:\n   - Entities like `CalendarComponent`, `Node`, `Model`, `StatsPanel`, `Index`, `Submenu`, `TagsMenu`, and `SummaryCategory` show moderate confidence (between ~7.7% and ~11.5%). These might also need attention depending on the nature of the changes made to `SummaryData.java`.\n\n3. **Low Confidence Relationships**:\n   - The rest of the entities listed have low confidence values (~3.85%), meaning they were rarely changed together with `SummaryData.java`. However, they might still be relevant if the change in `SummaryData.java` affects shared functionalities.\n\n### Next Steps\nTo determine which entities should be synchronized, we can dig deeper into the coupling dependencies between `SummaryData.java` and some of the key entities identified (e.g., `SummaryPanel`, `Reminder`, `SummaryTree`). Let's begin by analyzing the coupling dependencies between `SummaryData.java` and `SummaryPanel.java`. \n\nWould you like me to proceed with checking the coupling dependencies for one of these entities?",

Changes in `SummaryData.java` may likely impact or require updates in these files.\n\n2. **Moderate Confidence Relationships**:\n   - Entities like `CalendarComponent`, `Node`, `Model`, `StatsPanel`, `Index`, `Submenu`, `TagsMenu`, and `SummaryCategory` show moderate confidence (between ~7.7% and ~11.5%). These might also need attention depending on the nature of the changes made to `SummaryData.java`.\n\n3. **Low Confidence Relationships**:\n   - The rest of the entities listed have low confidence values (~3.85%), meaning they were rarely changed together with `SummaryData.java`. However, they might still be relevant if the change in `SummaryData.java` affects shared functionalities.\n\n### Next Steps\nTo determine which entities should be synchronized, we can dig deeper into the coupling dependencies between `SummaryData.java` and some of the key entities identified (e.g., `SummaryPanel`, `Reminder`, `SummaryTree`). Let's begin by analyzing the coupling dependencies between `SummaryData.java` and `SummaryPanel.java`. \n\nWould you like me to proceed with checking the coupling dependencies for one of these entities?",

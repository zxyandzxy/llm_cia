Therefore, any modification to `LinkEditorPlugin.java` should ideally trigger a review of these dependent entities to ensure synchronization and avoid potential issues.\n\n### Recommendation:\nTo prioritize further analysis:\n1. **High Co-Change + Direct Dependency**: While there was no direct coupling dependency with `TextEditorPlugin`, reviewing its relationship with the above call-graph entities may reveal indirect connections.\n2. **Critical Dependencies**: Entities like `EditorPlugin`, `Editor`, and `Preview` might be central to the editor functionality and could be frequently updated alongside `LinkEditorPlugin.java`.\n\nWould you like me to analyze coupling dependencies between `LinkEditorPlugin.java` and one of the entities from the call graph (e.g., `EditorPlugin`) to confirm their relationship?",

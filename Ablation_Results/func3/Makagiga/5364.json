They were occasionally changed alongside `Flags.java`, but not consistently enough to suggest a strong dependency.\n\n### Recommendation:\nTo proceed effectively with change impact analysis:\n1. Focus first on the high-confidence co-changed entities: `Tester`, `MDialog`, and `PrintDialog`. These are most likely impacted by changes in `Flags.java`.\n2. To understand the nature of these dependencies, use `get_coupling_dependencies` to determine if there are direct coupling types (e.g., method calls, inheritance, etc.) between `Flags.java` and these files.\n3. Additionally, analyze the call graph (`get_call_graph`) for `Flags.java` to identify any indirect usages or dependencies within the system.\n\nShall I proceed with analyzing the coupling dependencies?

It's possible that the functionality previously handled by `MTable.java` has been transferred or refactored into these entities.\n\n2. **Next Steps**:\n   - We could investigate `TaskTable.java` (which had the highest co-change confidence) to understand if it now assumes responsibilities previously managed by `MTable.java`.\n   - Alternatively, we could analyze other high-co-change entities such as `ColumnManager.java` or `TodoEditorCore.java` to explore potential synchronization requirements.\n\nWould you like me to proceed with analyzing one of these related entities?

                "content": "It appears that `MTable.java` has been removed from the project due to version iteration, which explains why we cannot retrieve its source code. This further suggests that the co-change relationships we observed may be a result of historical dependencies tied to the evolution of the project.\n\nSince `MTable.java` was central to our analysis and is no longer present in the current codebase, we should consider how this impacts our CIA task:\n\n1. **Historical Impact**: The co-change data indicates that entities like `TaskTable`, `TodoEditorCore`, and `ColumnManager` were frequently modified alongside `MTable.java`. It's possible that the functionality previously handled by `MTable.java` has been transferred or refactored into these entities.\n\n2. **Next Steps**:\n   - We could investigate `TaskTable.java` (which had the highest co-change confidence) to understand if it now assumes responsibilities previously managed by `MTable.java`.\n   - Alternatively, we could analyze other high-co-change entities such as `ColumnManager.java` or `TodoEditorCore.java` to explore potential synchronization requirements.\n\nWould you like me to proceed with analyzing one of these related entities? If so, please specify which one.",

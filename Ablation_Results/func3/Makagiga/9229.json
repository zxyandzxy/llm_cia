Entities with higher confidence scores are more likely to be impacted or need synchronization when changes occur in `SummaryData.java`. Here's how we interpret the results:\n\n### Key Findings:\n1. **High Confidence Scores**:\n   - `SummaryPanel` (confidence: 0.3077): This entity has the highest confidence score and appears in 8 out of the same change sets as `SummaryData.java`. It is very likely that this file needs to be synchronized alongside `SummaryData.java`.\n   - `Reminder` (confidence: 0.3077): Similarly, this file also shows up frequently in the same change sets and should be reviewed for potential synchronization.\n   - `SummaryTree` (confidence: 0.2308): Appears in 6 change sets along with `SummaryData.java`, indicating it might also be tightly coupled.\n\n2. **Moderate Confidence Scores**:\n   - `CalendarComponent` (confidence: 0.1154): Appears in 3 change sets alongside `SummaryData.java`.\n   - `Action` (confidence: 0.1923): Appears in 5 change sets.\n   - Other entities like `Node`, `Model`, `StatsPanel`, `Submenu`, `TagsMenu`, and `SummaryCategory` show moderate coupling but lower confidence than the top ones.\n\n3. **Low Confidence Scores**:\n   - The majority of other files appear only once alongside `SummaryData.java` (support = 1), leading to low confidence values (~0.038). These can potentially be ignored unless further investigation suggests otherwise.\n\n### Next Steps:\nTo confirm these relationships and identify direct dependencies, I will analyze the call graph of `SummaryData.java`. This will help determine which of these co-changed entities are directly referenced or used by `SummaryData.java`.\n\nLet me proceed with calling the `get_call_graph` function for `SummaryData.java`.",

Here's how we interpret the results:\n\n### Key Findings:\n1. **High Confidence Scores**:\n   - `SummaryPanel` (confidence: 0.3077): This entity has the highest confidence score and appears in 8 out of the same change sets as `SummaryData.java`. It is very likely that this file needs to be synchronized alongside `SummaryData.java`.\n   - `Reminder` (confidence: 0.3077): Similarly, this file also shows up frequently in the same change sets and should be reviewed for potential synchronization.\n   - `SummaryTree` (confidence: 0.2308): Appears in 6 change sets along with `SummaryData.java`, indicating it might also be tightly coupled.\n\n2. **Moderate Confidence Scores**:\n   - `CalendarComponent` (confidence: 0.1154): Appears in 3 change sets alongside `SummaryData.java`.\n   - `Action` (confidence: 0.1923): Appears in 5 change sets.\n   - Other entities like `Node`, `Model`, `StatsPanel`, `Submenu`, `TagsMenu`, and `SummaryCategory` show moderate coupling but lower confidence than the top ones.\n\n3. **Low Confidence Scores**:\n   - The majority of other files appear only once alongside `SummaryData.java` (support = 1), leading to low confidence values (~0.038). These can potentially be ignored unless further investigation suggests otherwise.\n\n### Next Steps:\nTo confirm these relationships and identify direct dependencies, I will analyze the call graph of `SummaryData.java`. This will help determine which of these co-changed entities are directly referenced or used by `SummaryData.java`.\n\nLet me proceed with calling the `get_call_graph` function for `SummaryData.java`.",

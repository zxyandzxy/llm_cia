In order to help solve the CIA mission, you should first understand some necessary concepts\uff1a\n(1)entity: Entities represent source code files in CIA tasks, and all the CIA tasks under study are based on the Java language, so entities are files with the .java extension.\n(2)starting entity: The starting entity is also called salient entity, and the salient entity is the root change that causes the modification of the rest of entities in a change set, while the rest of entities are the dependency modification along with the salient one.\nYou will be presented with a starting entity and tools (functions) will be provided to access the more information of the origin system. Your task is to gradually explain which entity really need to be synchronized, based on the starting entity and the information obtained through the function-call. You have 7 chances to call the function to get more information."

Therefore, synchronization with `ParserCommand.java` is likely unnecessary unless specific contextual knowledge suggests otherwise.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of CIA Findings for `Database.java`:\n\nBased on both **co-change relationships** and **coupling dependencies**, the key files that should be synchronized with changes to `Database.java` are:\n\n1. **HsqlDatabaseProperties.java**\n   - High co-change confidence (~0.32)\n   - Strong coupling: used throughout `Database.java` methods, constructor calls, and property manipulations\n\n2. **Logger.java**\n   - Moderate-high co-change confidence (~0.176)\n   - Strong usage coupling: core logging functionality tightly integrated into database lifecycle operations\n\nOther files like `Session.java`, `ParserCommand.java`, and others with low coupling scores may not require synchronization unless specific contextual or functional dependencies exist outside the scope of this analysis.\n\nWould you like me to proceed with analyzing additional files or summarize the final list of entities to synchronize?",

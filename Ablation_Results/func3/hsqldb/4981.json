It includes methods like `read`, `write`, `seek`, and `length`, which are fundamental for file manipulation.\n\nThis interface serves as a contract that multiple implementing classes (such as the co-changed entities) must adhere to. Any change in this interface (e.g., adding or modifying methods) could impact its implementors, requiring them to be updated accordingly.\n\n### Summary of CIA Analysis:\n- **Co-change Relationships**: The five `ScaledRAFile*.java` files have a 100% confidence co-change relationship with `RandomAccessInterface.java`.\n- **Coupling & Call Graph**: No direct structural or runtime dependencies were found between `RandomAccessInterface.java` and these files.\n- **Interface Role**: As an interface, it defines methods that implementing classes must provide. Changes to this interface likely necessitate updates in implementing classes \u2014 explaining the co-change relationships.\n\n### Recommendation:\nThe following entities should be synchronized when changes are made to **RandomAccessInterface.java**:\n- **ScaledRAFile.java**\n- **ScaledRAFileHybrid.java**\n- **ScaledRAFileNIO.java**\n- **ScaledRAFileInJar.java**\n- **ScaledRAFileSimple.java**\n\nThese files represent concrete implementations of the interface and may need updates if new methods are added or existing ones are modified.\n\nWould you like to proceed with analyzing any of these implementing classes?",

This suggests that the synchronization behavior observed in the version history is not driven by direct code-level relationships but could instead be due to:\n\n1. **Functional or logical dependencies**: Developers might modify these files together because they logically relate to similar functionalities or features within the system.\n2. **Historical developer practices**: Developers may have adopted a pattern of modifying these files together during past development or testing activities.\n\nTo better understand the rationale for their synchronized changes, we can inspect the call graphs or analyze the source code of these files to see if there are indirect usages or runtime interactions that aren't captured by static coupling dependencies.\n\nWould you like me to proceed with analyzing the call graph of `TileTest.java` to explore further?",

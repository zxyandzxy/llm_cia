This means the file may no longer be actively used in the current version of the codebase, which could explain the lack of direct coupling with some co-changed entities.\n\nHowever, since this entity was part of a historical change set and we are performing change impact analysis, we should still consider its historical relationships for synchronization purposes.\n\nGiven the previous results, the most significant finding is the structural dependency between **HyperSearchOperationNode.java** and **HyperSearchFileNode.java**, which justifies synchronizing changes between them.\n\nLet\u2019s now summarize the final recommendation based on the analysis:\n- **HyperSearchFileNode.java** must be synchronized because of strong structural dependencies (type casting and instanceof checks).\n- **MouseHandler.java** shows a high co-change confidence (~0.83), suggesting a functional or indirect dependency; while there\u2019s no direct coupling, it might still warrant attention depending on the nature of the change.\n- Other entities like `HyperSearchResults.java`, `HyperSearchRequest.java`, etc., have lower confidence scores but could also be reviewed if the change is extensive.\n\nWould you like me to retrieve the source code of `HyperSearchFileNode.java` for further inspection?",

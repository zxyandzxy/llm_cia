In order to help solve the CIA mission, you should first understand some necessary concepts\uff1a\n(1)entity: Entities represent source code files in CIA tasks, and all the CIA tasks under study are based on the Java language, so entities are files with the .java extension.\n(2)starting entity: The starting entity is also called salient entity, and the salient entity is the root change that causes the modification of the rest of entities in a change set, while the rest of entities are the dependency modification along with the salient one.\nYou will be presented with a starting entity and tools (functions) will be provided to access the more information of the origin system. Your task is to gradually explain which entity really need to be synchronized, based on the starting entity and the information obtained through the function-call. You have 7 chances to call the function to get more information."

This indicates a major refactoring or architectural change in the system.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- If working with an older version of the project is possible, revisiting those versions could provide more insight into dependencies.\n- For synchronization purposes, developers should focus on understanding how functionality previously handled by `DefaultInputHandler.java` and its co-changed entities has been redistributed in the current version.\n\nWould you like me to proceed further, or would you prefer to refine our approach based on this summary?",

In order to help solve the CIA mission, you should first understand some necessary concepts\uff1a\n(1)entity: Entities represent source code files in CIA tasks, and all the CIA tasks under study are based on the Java language, so entities are files with the .java extension.\n(2)starting entity: The starting entity is also called salient entity, and the salient entity is the root change that causes the modification of the rest of entities in a change set, while the rest of entities are the dependency modification along with the salient one.\nYou will be presented with a starting entity and tools (functions) will be provided to access the more information of the origin system. Your task is to gradually explain which entity really need to be synchronized, based on the starting entity and the information obtained through the function-call.

This indicates a major refactoring or architectural change in the system.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- If working with an older version of the project is possible, revisiting those versions could provide more insight into dependencies.\n- For synchronization purposes, developers should focus on understanding how functionality previously handled by `DefaultInputHandler.java` and its co-changed entities has been redistributed in the current version.\n\nWould you like me to proceed further, or would you prefer to refine our approach based on this summary?",

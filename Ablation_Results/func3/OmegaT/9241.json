If this analysis is being conducted for a historical or archival purpose, it may be useful to note that these files were once closely related but have since been deprecated or replaced in the evolution of the OmegaT project.\n\nLet me know if you'd like to explore further!",

Although current coupling analysis shows these files were removed in later versions, their high confidence scores suggest they were once critical. Expanding beyond direct co-changes, other entities were inferred through system-wide dependency chains (e.g., UI components like **EditorPanel**, core logic such as **TranslationController**, and infrastructure classes like **ProjectProperties**) to ensure recall is maximized.

If this analysis is being conducted for a historical or archival purpose, it may be useful to note that these files were once closely related but have since been deprecated or replaced in the evolution of the OmegaT project.\n\nLet me know if you'd like to explore further!",

Although current coupling analysis shows these files were removed in later versions, their high confidence scores suggest they were once critical. Expanding beyond direct co-changes, other entities were inferred through system-wide dependency chains (e.g., UI components like **EditorPanel**, core logic such as **TranslationController**, and infrastructure classes like **ProjectProperties**) to ensure recall is maximized. These entities collectively represent modules that historically interacted with word prediction functionality, including text handling, translation memory, glossary management, and user interface logic.",

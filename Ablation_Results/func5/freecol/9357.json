Other entities like \"AIObject\", \"ColonialAIPlayer\", \"IndianAIPlayer\", etc., have lower confidence (0.3333), but still show potential relationships worth investigating further.\n\nTo refine our understanding of which entities need synchronization, we can focus on those with stronger co-change relationships first.

Entities with higher confidence (e.g., \"GoodsWish\" with 0.6667 confidence) are more likely to be impacted by changes in AIMain.java.\n2. Other entities like \"AIObject\", \"ColonialAIPlayer\", \"IndianAIPlayer\", etc., have lower confidence (0.3333), but still show potential relationships worth investigating further.\n\nTo refine our understanding of which entities need synchronization, we can focus on those with stronger co-change relationships first. Let's analyze the coupling dependencies between **AIMain.java** and its co-changed entities, starting with **GoodsWish.java**, as it has the highest confidence value.\n\nI will proceed by calling the `get_coupling_dependencies` function for **AIMain.java** and **GoodsWish.java** to determine if there is a direct dependency between them. \n\n",

Confidence indicates the probability that a given entity was modified alongside `ImageLibrary.java`.\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **High-confidence relationships (confidence > 0.1):**\n   - `GUI`: Confidence of 0.3235.\n   - `Canvas`: Confidence of 0.147.\n   - `TilePanel`: Confidence of 0.147.\n\n   These are the strongest candidates for synchronization since they were frequently modified together historically.\n\n2. **Moderate-confidence relationships (0.05 < confidence \u2264 0.1):**\n   - `MiniMap`: Confidence of 0.1176.\n   - `MapControls`: Confidence of 0.1176.\n   - `InGameController`: Confidence of 0.0882.\n   - `FreeColLookAndFeel`: Confidence of 0.0882.\n   - `ActionManager`: Confidence of 0.0882.\n   - `ZoomInAction`: Confidence of 0.0882.\n   - `ZoomOutAction`: Confidence of 0.0882.\n   - `MapEditorTransformPanel`: Confidence of 0.0882.\n   - `ColopediaPanel`: Confidence of 0.0882.\n\n   These entities also show notable correlation with `ImageLibrary.java` but to a lesser extent than the high-confidence group.\n\n3. **Low-confidence relationships (confidence \u2264 0.05):**\n   The rest of the entities in the list fall into this category, indicating weaker historical ties with `ImageLibrary.java`. They might still be relevant, but further analysis is needed to confirm their involvement.\n\n---\n\n### Next Steps:\n\nTo refine the list of entities that should be synchronized with `ImageLibrary.java`, we can analyze the coupling dependencies or semantic similarity with these entities using other functions. For example:\n\n- Use `get_coupling_dependencies` between `ImageLibrary.java` and key entities like `GUI`, `Canvas`, and `TilePanel` to identify direct code-level dependencies.\n- Use `get_conceptual_coupling` for the same set of entities to assess semantic similarity.\n\nWould you like to proceed by checking coupling dependencies for any specific entity?",

Confidence indicates the probability that a given entity was modified alongside `ImageLibrary.java`.\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **High-confidence relationships (confidence > 0.1):**\n   - `GUI`: Confidence of 0.3235.\n   - `Canvas`: Confidence of 0.147.\n   - `TilePanel`: Confidence of 0.147.\n\n   These are the strongest candidates for synchronization since they were frequently modified together historically.\n\n2. **Moderate-confidence relationships (0.05 < confidence \u2264 0.1):**\n   - `MiniMap`: Confidence of 0.1176.\n   - `MapControls`: Confidence of 0.1176.\n   - `InGameController`: Confidence of 0.0882.\n   - `FreeColLookAndFeel`: Confidence of 0.0882.\n   - `ActionManager`: Confidence of 0.0882.\n   - `ZoomInAction`: Confidence of 0.0882.\n   - `ZoomOutAction`: Confidence of 0.0882.\n   - `MapEditorTransformPanel`: Confidence of 0.0882.\n   - `ColopediaPanel`: Confidence of 0.0882.\n\n   These entities also show notable correlation with `ImageLibrary.java` but to a lesser extent than the high-confidence group.\n\n3. **Low-confidence relationships (confidence \u2264 0.05):**\n   The rest of the entities in the list fall into this category, indicating weaker historical ties with `ImageLibrary.java`. They might still be relevant, but further analysis is needed to confirm their involvement.\n\n---\n\n### Next Steps:\n\nTo refine the list of entities that should be synchronized with `ImageLibrary.java`, we can analyze the coupling dependencies or semantic similarity with these entities using other functions. For example:\n\n- Use `get_coupling_dependencies` between `ImageLibrary.java` and key entities like `GUI`, `Canvas`, and `TilePanel` to identify direct code-level dependencies.\n- Use `get_conceptual_coupling` for the same set of entities to assess semantic similarity.\n\nWould you like to proceed by checking coupling dependencies for any specific entity?",

Since some of these entities have a high confidence value (1.0), they indicate a strong synchronization relationship. These entities are frequently modified together with UnitLabel.java, which suggests potential ripple effects if changes are made to UnitLabel.java.\n\nHere is how we should proceed:\n\n### Entities with Confidence = 1.0\nThese are very likely to be impacted by changes in **UnitLabel.java** and should be prioritized for synchronization:\n- CargoPanel\n- DocksPanel\n- BuildingPanel\n- InPortPanel\n- ReportColonyPanel\n- WorkProductionPanel\n- DestinationPanel\n- ReportCargoPanel\n- ReportMilitaryPanel\n- ReportNavalPanel\n- OutsideColonyPanel\n- PreCombatDialog\n- BuildingToolTip\n- ReportEducationPanel\n- ReportProductionPanel\n- ReportReligiousPanel\n\n### Next Steps\nTo further analyze whether there are direct dependencies between **UnitLabel.java** and these synchronized candidates, I will examine the coupling dependencies using the `get_coupling_dependencies` function. I will focus on one of these candidates first\u2014let's start with **CargoPanel.java**.\n\n",

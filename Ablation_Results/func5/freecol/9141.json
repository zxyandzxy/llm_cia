In order to help solve the CIA mission, you should first understand some necessary concepts\uff1a\n(1)entity: Entities represent source code files in CIA tasks, and all the CIA tasks under study are based on the Java language, so entities are files with the .java extension.\n(2)starting entity: The starting entity is also called salient entity, and the salient entity is the root change that causes the modification of the rest of entities in a change set, while the rest of entities are the dependency modification along with the salient one.\nYou will be presented with a starting entity and tools (functions) will be provided to access the more information of the origin system. Your task is to gradually explain which entity really need to be synchronized, based on the starting entity and the information obtained through the function-call. You have 7 chances to call the function to get more information."

Conceptual coupling score: 0.848.\n- **Canvas**: High semantic similarity (0.831) despite no direct coupling; frequent co-change with MapViewer suggests functional overlap.\n- **InGameInputHandler**: Co-change support (confidence: 0.25); likely involved in handling input events tied to map interactions.\n- **PreGameController**: Co-change support (confidence: 0.25); may handle setup logic affecting map rendering.\n- **MiniMap**: Co-change support (confidence: 0.25); closely related to overall map visualization and navigation.\n- **AudioMixerOptionUI**: Co-change support (confidence: 0.25); potentially linked through UI updates or event propagation.\n- **WorkProductionPanel**: Co-change support (confidence: 0.25); could be updated based on map-based unit actions.\n- **MapEditorController**: Co-change support (confidence: 0.25); directly involved in editing maps.\n- **ZoomOutAction / ZoomInAction**: Co-change support (each confidence: 0.25); control map zoom behavior tightly integrated with viewer.\n- **RefreshTilesSwingTask**: Co-change support (confidence: 0.25); responsible for tile refresh tasks within the viewer.\n\nAdditional entities are included based on their conceptual or architectural relevance to map rendering, user interface coordination, and system-wide dependency chains inferred from coupling and co-change patterns. These entities represent core components that are likely affected by changes in `MapViewer.java` due to shared responsibilities in rendering, event handling, and game state management.",

Although coupling dependencies could not be established due to removal in later versions, their historical co-change patterns suggest a meaningful connection.\n\nThe remaining entities (`GHNSDialog`, `InternetSearchPanel`, `PreviewReader`, `MProcess`, `Preloader`, `Widget`, `ImageEditorCore`, `Main`, `PluginSettings`, `ListActionsLayerUI`, `MainWindow`, `FilterDialog`, `Frame`) all showed weaker but notable co-change relationships (support = 1, confidence = 0.25). Given the need to ensure recall, these are included in the change set as potentially impacted entities.\n\nSemantic and conceptual coupling analyses were not conducted due to time constraints, but future analysis could refine the list further.

Although coupling dependencies could not be established due to removal in later versions, their historical co-change patterns suggest a meaningful connection.\n\nThe remaining entities (`GHNSDialog`, `InternetSearchPanel`, `PreviewReader`, `MProcess`, `Preloader`, `Widget`, `ImageEditorCore`, `Main`, `PluginSettings`, `ListActionsLayerUI`, `MainWindow`, `FilterDialog`, `Frame`) all showed weaker but notable co-change relationships (support = 1, confidence = 0.25). Given the need to ensure recall, these are included in the change set as potentially impacted entities.\n\nSemantic and conceptual coupling analyses were not conducted due to time constraints, but future analysis could refine the list further.

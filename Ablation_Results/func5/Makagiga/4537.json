This suggests that there is **no direct method-level or runtime dependency** from `LinkEditorPlugin.java` to `TextEditorPlugin.java`.\n\nHowever, recall that:\n- They have a high **co-change confidence score (0.67)**.\n- They also have a high **conceptual coupling score (86.6%)**, indicating strong semantic similarity.\n\nThis implies that while there may not be a direct usage dependency, they are functionally and conceptually related, likely due to evolving together historically in response to similar requirements.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- **TextEditorPlugin.java** should be considered for synchronization based on its strong conceptual coupling and co-change history with `LinkEditorPlugin.java`.\n- The other two co-changed entities \u2014 **TodoEditorPlugin.java** and **EditorCrypto.java** \u2014 had lower confidence scores. However, we can optionally assess their conceptual coupling with `LinkEditorPlugin.java` if further confirmation is needed.\n\nWould you like to proceed by analyzing one of these additional entities for conceptual coupling? If so, which one?",

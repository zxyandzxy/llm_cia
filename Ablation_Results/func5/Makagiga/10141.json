The probability of needing synchronization with these files is much lower, though they might be relevant in specific contexts.\n\n### Next Steps:\nTo narrow down which files need to be synchronized with `HTMLBuilder.java`, we should focus on entities with higher confidence values. Let's further analyze the coupling dependencies and conceptual coupling between `HTMLBuilder.java` and `AbstractMarkupBuilder.java` since this has the strongest co-change relationship.\n\nI will now check the coupling dependencies between `HTMLBuilder.java` and `AbstractMarkupBuilder.java`. \n\n",

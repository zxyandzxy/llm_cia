We should also analyze coupling dependencies or conceptual similarity to confirm whether these high-confidence entities are actually semantically or structurally linked to `Vars.java`.\n\n### Recommended Action:\nTo further validate these relationships, we can use the `get_coupling_dependencies` or `get_conceptual_coupling` functions for the top candidates (e.g., `MainWindow`, `Tabs`, `SummaryPanel`) to see if there is actual code-level or semantic linkage between them and `Vars.java`.\n\nWould you like me to proceed by analyzing coupling dependencies for one of these high-confidence entities (e.g., `MainWindow`)?",

The list includes the number of supports (how many times they were co-modified) and confidence scores (the ratio of co-modifications to total modifications).\n\n### Observations:\n1. **High Confidence Entities**:\n   - `MainWindow` (Support: 3, Confidence: ~0.27)\n   - `Tabs`, `NewFolderDialog`, `MetaInfo`, `PropertiesPanel`, `ImageEditorCore`, `SummaryData`, `SummaryPanel`, `Console`, `EnumProperty`, `ChartModel` (Support: 2, Confidence: ~0.18)\n\n2. **Low Confidence Entities**:\n   - All others have a support count of 1 and lower confidence (~0.09), indicating weaker historical co-change relationships.\n\n### Next Steps:\n- To determine which entities are most relevant for synchronization with `Vars.java`, we can focus on those with higher confidence values first.\n- However, statistical co-change data alone may not be sufficient. We should also analyze coupling dependencies or conceptual similarity to confirm whether these high-confidence entities are actually semantically or structurally linked to `Vars.java`.\n\n### Recommended Action:\nTo further validate these relationships, we can use the `get_coupling_dependencies` or `get_conceptual_coupling` functions for the top candidates (e.g., `MainWindow`, `Tabs`, `SummaryPanel`) to see if there is actual code-level or semantic linkage between them and `Vars.java`.\n\nWould you like me to proceed by analyzing coupling dependencies for one of these high-confidence entities (e.g., `MainWindow`)?",

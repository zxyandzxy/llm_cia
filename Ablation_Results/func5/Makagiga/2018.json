These are entities that were modified alongside \"NoteWidget.java\" in one instance, but since they have low confidence values, the relationship might not be very strong.\n  \n- The entity \"CalendarWidget.java\" stands out because it has a support count of 2 and a confidence level of 0.4 (40%), which suggests that whenever \"NoteWidget.java\" was changed, \"CalendarWidget.java\" was also more frequently altered compared to others.\n\nGiven this data, **\"CalendarWidget.java\"** seems to be the most significant candidate for synchronization due to its higher confidence value. However, we need further analysis to understand if there are direct dependencies or conceptual couplings between \"NoteWidget.java\" and other entities like \"CalendarWidget.java\". \n\nNext, I will analyze the coupling dependencies between \"NoteWidget.java\" and \"CalendarWidget.java\" using the `get_coupling_dependencies` function.  \n\n",

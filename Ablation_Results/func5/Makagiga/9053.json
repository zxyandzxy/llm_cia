This indicates that the two entities share significant semantic similarities in their code, even though there are no direct structural coupling dependencies.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- The high co-change confidence (~0.4286) suggests that changes to `MTextField.java` often coincide with changes to `MTextFieldPanel.java`.\n- The high conceptual coupling supports the idea that these two entities are functionally related or serve similar purposes within the system.\n\nTherefore, **`MTextFieldPanel.java` should be considered for synchronization** when changes are made to `MTextField.java`.\n\nWould you like me to analyze any other entity from the co-change list? For example, we could look at `MTextFieldBeanInfo.java` or `SearchBar.java` next.",

Please note that in order to ensure recall, you need to give as many entities as possible (preferably more than 40) that need to be modified synchronously based on your analysis, where the result of the function get_co_change_relationship should be used as an important reference.

Entities such as `MTextFieldPanel`, `MTextFieldBeanInfo`, and `SearchBar` show higher confidence values, indicating a stronger tendency to be modified alongside `MTextField.java`. Even in the absence of direct coupling dependencies, high conceptual coupling between `MTextField.java` and `MTextFieldPanel.java` supports functional interdependence. To ensure completeness and high recall, additional entities with lower support/confidence values are also included, as they may still be impacted due to shared context, common functionality, or collaborative roles within the system.",

In order to help solve the CIA mission, you should first understand some necessary concepts\uff1a\n(1)entity: Entities represent source code files in CIA tasks, and all the CIA tasks under study are based on the Java language, so entities are files with the .java extension.\n(2)starting entity: The starting entity is also called salient entity, and the salient entity is the root change that causes the modification of the rest of entities in a change set, while the rest of entities are the dependency modification along with the salient one.\nYou will be presented with a starting entity and tools (functions) will be provided to access the more information of the origin system. Your task is to gradually explain which entity really need to be synchronized, based on the starting entity and the information obtained through the function-call.

The co-change analysis identified several files that were historically modified alongside `Main.java`, but some (like `Wizard.java` and `StatsDialog.java`) have since been removed from the project.\n2. Using the call graph, we identified active dependencies of `Main.java`: `IconTheme`, `FS`, `MLogger`, `MApplication`, and `Args`.\n3. Among these, `IconTheme.java` has a high conceptual coupling score (~0.8566), making it a strong candidate for synchronization consideration.\n\n### Final Steps:\nTo complete the impact analysis, we should similarly evaluate the conceptual coupling between `Main.java` and the remaining entities in the call graph (`FS`, `MLogger`, `MApplication`, and `Args`). We'll continue this with `FS.java` next.\n\nLet\u2019s proceed with checking the conceptual coupling between `Main.java` and `FS.java`.\n",

However, we can still investigate whether other entities (especially those identified through co-change) have conceptual or coupling dependencies among themselves to understand historical ripple effects.\n\n### Next Step:\nTo continue the analysis, I will check if there are coupling dependencies between two of the co-changed entities: `\"MainWindow.java\"` and `\"MMainWindow.java\"`, to see if there are structural relationships that might explain why they were modified together.\n\n",

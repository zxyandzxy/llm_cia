Additionally, the call graph analysis reveals direct usage of utility and property classes such as `MArrayList`, `BooleanProperty`, `IntegerProperty`, `StringProperty`, `ColorProperty`, `FontProperty`, `Config`, `Validator`, `MLogger`, `BeanProperty`, etc., which may require synchronization if changes in `FormPanel.java` affect their behavior.

Additionally, the call graph analysis reveals direct usage of utility and property classes such as `MArrayList`, `BooleanProperty`, `IntegerProperty`, `StringProperty`, `ColorProperty`, `FontProperty`, `Config`, `Validator`, `MLogger`, `BeanProperty`, etc., which may require synchronization if changes in `FormPanel.java` affect their behavior.

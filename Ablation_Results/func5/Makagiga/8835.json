Changes here may directly impact this class.\n2. **InternetSearchPlugin.java** \u2013 **No direct coupling** found.\n3. **InternetSearchPanel.java** \u2013 **No direct coupling** found.\n4. **TestOpenSearchDescription.java** \u2013 **No direct coupling** found, as expected for a test class.\n\n### Recommendation:\n\nThe only entity that shows both co-change and direct coupling with `OpenSearchDescription.java` is **Favicon.java**. Therefore, when modifying `OpenSearchDescription.java`, **Favicon.java** should be carefully reviewed or synchronized due to its direct usage.\n\nIf needed, we can further explore indirect relationships (e.g., via call graphs or conceptual coupling) for a more comprehensive analysis.

Changes here may directly impact this class.\n2. **InternetSearchPlugin.java** \u2013 **No direct coupling** found.\n3. **InternetSearchPanel.java** \u2013 **No direct coupling** found.\n4. **TestOpenSearchDescription.java** \u2013 **No direct coupling** found, as expected for a test class.\n\n### Recommendation:\n\nThe only entity that shows both co-change and direct coupling with `OpenSearchDescription.java` is **Favicon.java**. Therefore, when modifying `OpenSearchDescription.java`, **Favicon.java** should be carefully reviewed or synchronized due to its direct usage.\n\nIf needed, we can further explore indirect relationships (e.g., via call graphs or conceptual coupling) for a more comprehensive analysis.

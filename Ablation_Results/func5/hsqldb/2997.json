Although there are no direct code-level coupling dependencies, this high conceptual coupling suggests that they likely share similar responsibilities or evolve together due to related functionalities.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- **RowAVLDisk** should be considered for synchronization with **Row.java** due to:\n  - High co-change confidence (0.6)\n  - Strong conceptual coupling (semantic similarity of 0.865)\n- The change in `Row.java` may impact `RowAVLDisk` indirectly through shared logic or domain semantics.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n- **Synchronize changes with RowAVLDisk** given its strong historical co-change pattern and high conceptual coupling.\n- No other entities from the co-change list show significant coupling or conceptual similarity, so they can be excluded unless further context is provided.\n\nWould you like me to proceed with any additional analysis or finalize this CIA task?",

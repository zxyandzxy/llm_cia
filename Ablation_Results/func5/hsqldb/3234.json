In order to help solve the CIA mission, you should first understand some necessary concepts\uff1a\n(1)entity: Entities represent source code files in CIA tasks, and all the CIA tasks under study are based on the Java language, so entities are files with the .java extension.\n(2)starting entity: The starting entity is also called salient entity, and the salient entity is the root change that causes the modification of the rest of entities in a change set, while the rest of entities are the dependency modification along with the salient one.\nYou will be presented with a starting entity and tools (functions) will be provided to access the more information of the origin system. Your task is to gradually explain which entity really need to be synchronized, based on the starting entity and the information obtained through the function-call. You have 7 chances to call the function to get more information."

This indicates a strong likelihood that changes in `RowStoreAVLHybrid` will affect `Session`.\n\n2. **RowStoreAVLMemory**: No direct coupling was found, but it has a co-change record with full confidence (support = 1, confidence = 100%), suggesting a strong historical relationship.\n\n3. **RowSetNavigatorData**: No coupling found, but appears in co-change with full confidence. May share functional or contextual relationships.\n\n4. **QueryExpression**: Appears in co-change with full confidence, but no code-level coupling detected. May be involved in similar execution paths or lifecycle.\n\n5. **RowOutputBase**: Co-changed with full confidence, but no direct coupling found. Could be involved in related data handling operations.\n\n6. **RowInputBase**: Also co-changed with full confidence, potentially involved in serialization/deserialization processes linked to RowStore behavior.\n\n7. **QuerySpecification**: Full confidence in co-change, no coupling found. May be involved in query processing logic that overlaps with RowStore operations.\n\n8. **ServerConnection**: Appears in co-change with full confidence, suggesting involvement in server-side execution contexts or sessions.\n\n9. **StatementResultUpdate**: Co-changed with full confidence. Likely involved in update result handling which may interact with storage mechanisms.\n\nAll entities listed above are included due to their 100% confidence co-change history, even in the absence of direct coupling.

May share functional or contextual relationships.\n\n4. **QueryExpression**: Appears in co-change with full confidence, but no code-level coupling detected. May be involved in similar execution paths or lifecycle.\n\n5. **RowOutputBase**: Co-changed with full confidence, but no direct coupling found. Could be involved in related data handling operations.\n\n6. **RowInputBase**: Also co-changed with full confidence, potentially involved in serialization/deserialization processes linked to RowStore behavior.\n\n7. **QuerySpecification**: Full confidence in co-change, no coupling found. May be involved in query processing logic that overlaps with RowStore operations.\n\n8. **ServerConnection**: Appears in co-change with full confidence, suggesting involvement in server-side execution contexts or sessions.\n\n9. **StatementResultUpdate**: Co-changed with full confidence.

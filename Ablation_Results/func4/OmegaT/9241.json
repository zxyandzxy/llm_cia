In order to help solve the CIA mission, you should first understand some necessary concepts\uff1a\n(1)entity: Entities represent source code files in CIA tasks, and all the CIA tasks under study are based on the Java language, so entities are files with the .java extension.\n(2)starting entity: The starting entity is also called salient entity, and the salient entity is the root change that causes the modification of the rest of entities in a change set, while the rest of entities are the dependency modification along with the salient one.\nYou will be presented with a starting entity and tools (functions) will be provided to access the more information of the origin system. Your task is to gradually explain which entity really need to be synchronized, based on the starting entity and the information obtained through the function-call. You have 7 chances to call the function to get more information."

However, for a full Change Impact Analysis, we should consider the following next steps:\n\n1. **Identify Replacement Components:** Investigate whether new components have taken over the responsibilities of the removed files (e.g., new predictor or completer modules).\n2. **Examine High-Level Architecture Changes:** Look into recent architectural changes or refactorings that may explain why these files were removed.\n3. **Trace New Dependencies:** If there is an updated version of a word prediction or text completion feature, analyze its dependencies to understand potential ripple effects in the current system.\n\nWould you like to proceed by searching for replacement components or analyzing architectural changes?",

This indicates that in past modifications, these files were consistently changed together with `WordPredictor.java`, suggesting strong functional or dependency linkage. Although our subsequent checks revealed that all of these entities have been removed due to project version iteration, their historical co-change relationship implies that any change to `WordPredictor.java` previously had ripple effects across these files.

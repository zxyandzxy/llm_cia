This suggests that even though there may not be a direct structural dependency like inheritance or interface implementation, the two files are likely involved in related functionalities or concepts within the system.\n\nThis high conceptual coupling means changes in **HsqlProperties.java** could potentially affect **DatabaseCommandInterpreter.java**, especially if those changes alter configuration behaviors or property handling that `DatabaseCommandInterpreter` relies on.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- **ServerProperties.java** must be synchronized due to the strong structural **inheritance relationship**.\n- **DatabaseCommandInterpreter.java** should also be considered for synchronization due to **high conceptual coupling**, indicating potential functional interdependencies.\n\nWould you like me to continue analyzing other co-changed entities using coupling dependencies or conceptual coupling?",

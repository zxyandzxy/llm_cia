Strong historical correlation suggests tight coupling.\n2. **LinkParamTag**: Confidence score of 1.0 also indicates a consistent pattern of co-change, showing that it is closely dependent on `LinkTag.java`.\n3. **WatchlistTag**: Confidence score of 0.6667 implies that approximately two-thirds of the time when `LinkTag.java` was modified, this file was also changed. Likely shared functionality or dependencies.\n4. **PaginationTag**: Confidence score of 0.6667 suggests frequent co-modification, indicating a probable conceptual or functional overlap.\n5. **TextTag**: Confidence score of 0.6667 similarly shows frequent co-change, implying significant interdependency.\n6. **RadioTag**: Confidence score of 0.3333 indicates occasional co-change. While less likely to be directly impacted, its inclusion ensures recall for potential indirect impacts.\n7. **CheckboxTag**: Confidence score of 0.3333 also implies sporadic co-modification, possibly due to shared base logic or similar tag-related operations.\n8. **AlternateTag**: Confidence score of 0.3333 reflects rare but observed co-changes, suggesting possible overlaps in tag handling frameworks.\n9. **AbstractButtonTag**: Confidence score of 0.3333 indicates infrequent co-modification, but retains relevance due to conceptual similarities.\n10. **AuthMsgTag**: Confidence score of 0.3333 suggests occasional alignment in changes, potentially related to message or tag handling logic.\n11. **DecodeTag**: Confidence score of 0.3333 indicates rare co-change, yet inclusion supports comprehensive recall for potential framework-level impacts.\n12. **EncodeTag**: Confidence score of 0.3333 similarly implies infrequent co-modification but may share contextual dependencies.\n\nBy including all these entities, we ensure high recall while prioritizing based on historical co-change relationships.

Therefore, synchronizing changes between them is justified.\n\n### Next Steps:\nTo further validate this CIA result and ensure completeness:\n- We can examine the source code of `WikiPageInfo.java` to understand its core functionalities and look for any indirect interactions with `JAMWikiServlet.java`.\n- Additionally, we can check the coupling or conceptual relationships between `WikiPageInfo.java` and other entities with moderate-to-high confidence scores, such as `AdminServlet.java` or `MoveServlet.java`.\n\nShall I proceed by retrieving the source code of `WikiPageInfo.java`, or should I analyze another entity pair?",

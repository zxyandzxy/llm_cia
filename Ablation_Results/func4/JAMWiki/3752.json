This indicates a strong correlation, suggesting that `WikiConfiguration.java` should be considered for synchronization.\n\n- **High to Medium Confidence (0.75 to 0.5):**\n  - **SpamFilter.java** (0.75): Modified 3 out of 4 times when `ResourceUtil.java` was changed.\n  - **Environment.java**, **WikiUtil.java**, **TestFileUtil.java**, and **ServletUtil.java**, **DatabaseConnection.java** (all at 0.5): These were modified 2 out of 4 times when `ResourceUtil.java` was updated. They show moderate coupling and could potentially need synchronization depending on the nature of changes.\n\n- **Low Confidence (<0.5):**\n  - The remaining files have lower confidence values (e.g., 0.25), indicating they are less frequently changed in conjunction with `ResourceUtil.java`. These may not require immediate attention unless specific changes in `ResourceUtil.java` directly impact them.\n\n### Next Steps:\nTo refine our understanding further, it would be beneficial to analyze the conceptual coupling between `ResourceUtil.java` and these co-changed files, especially those with high confidence levels like `WikiConfiguration.java`. I will now call the `get_conceptual_coupling` function to measure semantic similarity with `WikiConfiguration.java`.\n\nLet me proceed with the next step.\n",

Here's how we can interpret the results for potential synchronization:\n\n- **High Confidence (1.0):**\n  - **WikiConfiguration.java**: With a confidence level of 1.0, this file has always been modified alongside `ResourceUtil.java`. This indicates a strong correlation, suggesting that `WikiConfiguration.java` should be considered for synchronization.\n\n- **High to Medium Confidence (0.75 to 0.5):**\n  - **SpamFilter.java** (0.75): Modified 3 out of 4 times when `ResourceUtil.java` was changed.\n  - **Environment.java**, **WikiUtil.java**, **TestFileUtil.java**, and **ServletUtil.java**, **DatabaseConnection.java** (all at 0.5): These were modified 2 out of 4 times when `ResourceUtil.java` was updated. They show moderate coupling and could potentially need synchronization depending on the nature of changes.\n\n- **Low Confidence (<0.5):**\n  - The remaining files have lower confidence values (e.g., 0.25), indicating they are less frequently changed in conjunction with `ResourceUtil.java`. These may not require immediate attention unless specific changes in `ResourceUtil.java` directly impact them.\n\n### Next Steps:\nTo refine our understanding further, it would be beneficial to analyze the conceptual coupling between `ResourceUtil.java` and these co-changed files, especially those with high confidence levels like `WikiConfiguration.java`. I will now call the `get_conceptual_coupling` function to measure semantic similarity with `WikiConfiguration.java`.\n\nLet me proceed with the next step.\n",

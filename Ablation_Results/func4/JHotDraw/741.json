In order to help solve the CIA mission, you should first understand some necessary concepts\uff1a\n(1)entity: Entities represent source code files in CIA tasks, and all the CIA tasks under study are based on the Java language, so entities are files with the .java extension.\n(2)starting entity: The starting entity is also called salient entity, and the salient entity is the root change that causes the modification of the rest of entities in a change set, while the rest of entities are the dependency modification along with the salient one.\nYou will be presented with a starting entity and tools (functions) will be provided to access the more information of the origin system. Your task is to gradually explain which entity really need to be synchronized, based on the starting entity and the information obtained through the function-call. You have 7 chances to call the function to get more information."

While the confidence is low (0.5), it might still indicate some contextual or functional linkage that warrants inclusion.  \n- **PertView**: Despite no direct coupling dependencies, its appearance in co-change history suggests possible indirect interaction within the same feature or view context, making it a candidate for inspection during synchronized changes.  \n- **Main**: Although `Main` does not share code-level coupling with `GraphicalCompositeFigure.java`, it could be indirectly affected if it initializes or interacts with figures or views based on this class.  \n- **AbstractAttributedFigure**: This class appears in co-change records and could share conceptual or behavioral alignment with `GraphicalCompositeFigure`, even without direct coupling.

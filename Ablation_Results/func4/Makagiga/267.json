Some notable ones include:\n- **TodoEditor.java**\n- **RichTextPane.java**\n- **Factory.java**\n\nThese entities show some historical correlation and should be reviewed for possible dependencies, especially if the current change involves broader functionality changes.\n\n### Next Steps:\nTo proceed further with accuracy, I recommend investigating coupling dependencies between `TextEditor.java` and these top candidates (`TextEditorCore.java`, `TextEditorDesigner.java`, etc.) using the `get_coupling_dependencies` function. Let me know which specific relationships you'd like to explore!",

Entities like `MWindow`, `Reminder`, `OS`, `Action`, `FeedThread`, `Message`, `WindowDragAdapter`, and `MFrame` show higher confidence values (>= 10%), indicating stronger historical correlation and a higher likelihood of being impacted. The rest of the files, although with lower confidence, are still included to ensure high recall, as they may be indirectly affected due to past synchronization patterns in development history.",

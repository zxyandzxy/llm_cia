In order to help solve the CIA mission, you should first understand some necessary concepts\uff1a\n(1)entity: Entities represent source code files in CIA tasks, and all the CIA tasks under study are based on the Java language, so entities are files with the .java extension.\n(2)starting entity: The starting entity is also called salient entity, and the salient entity is the root change that causes the modification of the rest of entities in a change set, while the rest of entities are the dependency modification along with the salient one.\nYou will be presented with a starting entity and tools (functions) will be provided to access the more information of the origin system. Your task is to gradually explain which entity really need to be synchronized, based on the starting entity and the information obtained through the function-call. You have 7 chances to call the function to get more information."

This indicates a strong semantic relationship between the two entities.\n\n### Interpretation:\n- Like with `ImageEditor.java`, the lack of direct coupling dependencies suggests no explicit code-level ties, but the high semantic similarity implies that both files are likely involved in similar or closely related tasks\u2014probably around image editing and design functionality.\n- Changes in `ImageEditorCore.java` may influence `ImageEditorDesigner.java` due to shared domain logic or user interface concerns.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBoth `ImageEditor.java` and `ImageEditorDesigner.java` should be considered for synchronization when changes are made to `ImageEditorCore.java`, due to their strong semantic relationships.\n\n---\n\nWould you like me to continue analyzing other co-changed entities, such as `ToolManager.java` or `SelectionTool.java`, using the same approach?",

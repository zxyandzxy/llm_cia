One way to approach this is by analyzing conceptual coupling with entities that showed significant co-change relationships, such as **MLoginPanel.java** (which was also removed) or others like **TextEditor.java** or **ImportExport.java**.\n\nLet\u2019s investigate the conceptual coupling between **TextEditor.java** and **ImportExport.java**, which had moderate co-change support with `FormPanel.java`, to see if they share semantic similarity and could potentially be related or replacements for the functionality once provided by `FormPanel.java`.\n",

This suggests that when `Globals.java` is modified, these files are also likely to be affected and may need synchronization.\n\n- **Medium Confidence (0.25):**\n  Several other files such as `MURLButton`, `PluginSettings`, `ValidatorMessage`, etc., have lower confidence values (25%). While not as strongly correlated, they might still require attention depending on the nature of the changes in `Globals.java`.\n\n### Next Steps:\nTo further analyze which entities truly need synchronization, I propose the following:\n1. Examine the coupling dependencies between `Globals.java` and the high-confidence co-changed files (`LinkEditor`, `StaticHandler`, `InternetSearchPanel`) using the `get_coupling_dependencies` function.\n2. Additionally, check the conceptual coupling (semantic similarity) between `Globals.java` and these high-confidence files using the `get_conceptual_coupling` function.\n\nThis will help us identify whether there are actual structural or semantic relationships driving these co-changes.\n\nLet me proceed by analyzing the coupling dependencies with the highest confidence file: `LinkEditor`.\n\n",

Please note that in order to ensure recall, you need to give as many entities as possible (preferably more than 40) that need to be modified synchronously based on your analysis, where the result of the function get_co_change_relationship should be used as an important reference.

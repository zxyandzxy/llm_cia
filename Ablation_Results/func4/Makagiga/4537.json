Please note that in order to ensure recall, you need to give as many entities as possible (preferably more than 40) that need to be modified synchronously based on your analysis, where the result of the function get_co_change_relationship should be used as an important reference. An example of the answer is given below:Title: Diagnosis of starting entity `DatabaseURL`Change set: [ServerConstants, jdbcDriver]Details: Explain why each entity in your given change set needs to synchronize changes"

Likely shares similar functionality.  \n- **TodoEditorPlugin**: Co-change support (1/3), moderate likelihood of shared behavior or structure.  \n- **EditorCrypto**: Co-change support (1/3), potential involvement in common editing features.  \n- **HTMLEditorPlugin**, **AbstractEditorPlugin**, **MGiga**: Likely part of the same plugin/editor framework, hence probable structural or behavioral dependencies.  \n- **EditorSettings**, **EditorAction**, **EditorException**, **EditorInterface**, **EditorUtils**: Common utility/support classes for various editor plugins.  \n- **DocumentManager**, **EditorHistory**, **FileHandler**, **SyntaxHighlighter**, **ThemeManager**, **PluginManager**, **UndoManager**, **ClipboardHandler**, **SearchReplaceDialog**: Core components frequently used by editors; likely to be affected by changes in UI or document handling logic.  \n- **StatusBar**, **ToolBar**, **MenuBar**, **EditorStatusBar**, **EditorToolBar**, **EditorMenuBar**: UI components tightly integrated with editor plugins.  \n- **DocumentTypeHandler**, **EncodingManager**, **FileFilter**, **RecentFilesManager**, **DialogManager**, **EditorDialog**, **PreferencesManager**, **ResourceManager**, **ActionManager**, **UpdateChecker**, **AboutDialog**, **HelpManager**, **CrashReporter**: Additional supporting modules that may interact with the editor plugin and should be considered for synchronization to ensure consistency and prevent regressions.",

In order to help solve the CIA mission, you should first understand some necessary concepts\uff1a\n(1)entity: Entities represent source code files in CIA tasks, and all the CIA tasks under study are based on the Java language, so entities are files with the .java extension.\n(2)starting entity: The starting entity is also called salient entity, and the salient entity is the root change that causes the modification of the rest of entities in a change set, while the rest of entities are the dependency modification along with the salient one.\nYou will be presented with a starting entity and tools (functions) will be provided to access the more information of the origin system. Your task is to gradually explain which entity really need to be synchronized, based on the starting entity and the information obtained through the function-call. You have 7 chances to call the function to get more information."

                "content": "The source code for `SummaryPanel` reveals that it is primarily responsible for managing a summary view in the UI, including:\n\n- A search panel (`MSearchPanel`) for filtering tasks.\n- A tree structure (`SummaryTree`) to display hierarchical data (likely related to tasks).\n- Toolbar functionality for actions like printing and settings.\n- Integration with application variables (`Vars.summaryShowAllTasks`, `Vars.alarmEnabled`) to manage UI state.\n\nIt also implements focus handling and synchronization via its singleton pattern.\n\n### Observations:\n1. **UI Functionality**: `SummaryPanel` seems to be part of the application's user interface layer dealing with task management or data visualization.\n2. **No Direct Password Logic**: There is no direct indication that `SummaryPanel` handles password-related logic, which was likely the domain of `MPasswordPanel.java`.\n\n### Next Steps:\nSince `SummaryPanel` exists and shows general UI responsibilities, but not password-specific features, we should now investigate other co-changed entities from the earlier list that may have absorbed password-related functionality. One such candidate is `EditorCrypto.java`, which might handle cryptographic operations that could be tied to password logic.\n\nLet me retrieve the conceptual coupling between `MPasswordPanel.java` and `EditorCrypto.java`.\n",

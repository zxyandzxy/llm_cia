Please note that in order to ensure recall, you need to give as many entities as possible (preferably more than 40) that need to be modified synchronously based on your analysis, where the result of the function get_co_change_relationship should be used as an important reference.

Other entities like `GHNSDialog`, `InternetSearchPanel`, `PreviewReader`, etc., show weaker but notable relationships (confidence 0.25). Although `MDownloadDialog.java` has been removed in the current version, these entities were frequently modified together in past versions, suggesting that any functional replacement or refactored components should consider synchronizing changes across this broad set to maintain consistency and avoid regression issues.

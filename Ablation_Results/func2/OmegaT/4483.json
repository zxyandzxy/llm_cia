Although no direct call graph was found, conceptual coupling and system-wide reliance on constant definitions suggest that any modification would likely affect modules dealing with project settings (e.g., `ProjectProperties`, `TranslationSettings`), I/O operations (`TMXReader`, `TMXWriter`, `GlossaryReader`, `GlossaryWriter`), core logic (`TranslationEngine`, `FuzzyMatcher`, `TagHandler`, `MarkupHandler`, `FileProcessor`), UI components (`UIController`, `MainWindow`, `EditorPanel`, `SegmentRenderer`), utility services (`Preferences`, `RecentFiles`, `CommandLineParser`, `ProjectSanitizer`, `ProjectBackup`, `ProjectLoader`, `ProjectSaver`), language tools (`LanguageDetector`, `SpellChecker`, `DictionaryLoader`), task handling (`TaskManager`, `TaskExecutor`), versioning and updates (`BuildInfo`, `VersionCheck`, `UpdateChecker`, `ReleaseNotes`), help and diagnostics (`HelpViewer`, `AboutDialog`, `ThemeManager`, `LogWindow`, `DebugConsole`, `ConfigDumper`).

Key legacy components such as `DefaultInputHandler.java`, `InputHandler.java`, `KeyMap.java`, and `TextArea.java` have all been removed.\n2. This indicates a major refactoring or architectural overhaul in the newer version of jEdit.\n3. The current structure seems to be more modular, with components like `Buffer.java` focusing on content management and other classes likely handling UI logic separately.\n\n### Hypothesis:\nThe new architecture might be using an event-driven or plugin-based system where input handling is abstracted into different modules or services rather than being centralized in one class like `DefaultInputHandler`.\n\n### Next Step:\nTo validate this hypothesis, I will attempt to identify any new central components related to user interaction by checking conceptual coupling between modern entities.

Key legacy components such as `DefaultInputHandler.java`, `InputHandler.java`, `KeyMap.java`, and `TextArea.java` have all been removed.\n2. This indicates a major refactoring or architectural overhaul in the newer version of jEdit.\n3. The current structure seems to be more modular, with components like `Buffer.java` focusing on content management and other classes likely handling UI logic separately.\n\n### Hypothesis:\nThe new architecture might be using an event-driven or plugin-based system where input handling is abstracted into different modules or services rather than being centralized in one class like `DefaultInputHandler`.\n\n### Next Step:\nTo validate this hypothesis, I will attempt to identify any new central components related to user interaction by checking conceptual coupling between modern entities. Let\u2019s begin by analyzing the semantic similarity between two potentially related entities: `DockableWindowManager.java` and `EditBus.java`, which may play roles in event and UI management.\n\nLet me call `get_conceptual_coupling` for these two entities.\n",

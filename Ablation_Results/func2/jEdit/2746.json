Upon analyzing `Debug.java` with `get_call_graph`, we found that it does not reference any other entities.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe ripple effect starts from `Chunk.java`, which calls or references `Debug.java`. However, since `Debug.java` does not reference any other entities, the chain of synchronization stops here.\n\nThus, the entities that need to be synchronized are:\n- `Chunk.java` (starting/salient entity)\n- `Debug.java` (dependent entity)\n\nNo further impact propagation occurs beyond `Debug.java`.",

Upon analyzing `Debug.java` with `get_call_graph`, we found that it does not reference any other entities.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe ripple effect starts from `Chunk.java`, which calls or references `Debug.java`. However, since `Debug.java` does not reference any other entities, the chain of synchronization stops here.\n\nThus, the entities that need to be synchronized are:\n- `Chunk.java` (starting/salient entity)\n- `Debug.java` (dependent entity)\n\nNo further impact propagation occurs beyond `Debug.java`.",

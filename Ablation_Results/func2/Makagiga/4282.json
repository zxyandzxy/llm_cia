In order to help solve the CIA mission, you should first understand some necessary concepts\uff1a\n(1)entity: Entities represent source code files in CIA tasks, and all the CIA tasks under study are based on the Java language, so entities are files with the .java extension.\n(2)starting entity: The starting entity is also called salient entity, and the salient entity is the root change that causes the modification of the rest of entities in a change set, while the rest of entities are the dependency modification along with the salient one.\nYou will be presented with a starting entity and tools (functions) will be provided to access the more information of the origin system. Your task is to gradually explain which entity really need to be synchronized, based on the starting entity and the information obtained through the function-call. You have 7 chances to call the function to get more information."

This indicates that `TagsUtils.java` directly relies on a static method in `Query`. Any change in this method signature or behavior might affect `TagsUtils.java`.\n   - **MetaInfo**: No coupling dependencies were found between `TagsUtils.java` and `MetaInfo`. Thus, it is unlikely that changes in `TagsUtils.java` will have an impact on `MetaInfo`.\n   - **Hit**: The entity `Hit` was referenced by `TagsUtils.java`, but it has been removed from the project due to version iteration. Therefore, no synchronization is required with `Hit`.\n\n### Conclusion:  \nThe only entity that needs to be synchronized or carefully reviewed for potential ripple effects from changes in `TagsUtils.java` is `Query`, due to the existing static method invocation dependency.\n\nWould you like further details about `Query` or its coupling dependencies?",

This indicates that `TagsUtils.java` directly relies on a static method in `Query`. Any change in this method signature or behavior might affect `TagsUtils.java`.\n   - **MetaInfo**: No coupling dependencies were found between `TagsUtils.java` and `MetaInfo`. Thus, it is unlikely that changes in `TagsUtils.java` will have an impact on `MetaInfo`.\n   - **Hit**: The entity `Hit` was referenced by `TagsUtils.java`, but it has been removed from the project due to version iteration. Therefore, no synchronization is required with `Hit`.\n\n### Conclusion:  \nThe only entity that needs to be synchronized or carefully reviewed for potential ripple effects from changes in `TagsUtils.java` is `Query`, due to the existing static method invocation dependency.\n\nWould you like further details about `Query` or its coupling dependencies?",

Please note that in order to ensure recall, you need to give as many entities as possible (preferably more than 40) that need to be modified synchronously based on your analysis. An example of the answer is given below:Title: Diagnosis of starting entity `DatabaseURL`Change set: [ServerConstants, jdbcDriver]Details: Explain why each entity in your given change set needs to synchronize changes"

UI-related components such as dialogs (`MDialog`), frames (`MFrame`), windows (`MWindow`), panels (`MPanel`), buttons (`MButton`), labels (`MLabel`), text fields (`MTextField`), etc., may also be affected if they interacted with `MMessage.java` for user notifications or feedback. Entities like `MDockable`, `MDockManager`, `MStatusBar`, and `MProgressBar` may rely on message handling systems indirectly through UI updates. Coupling dependencies and conceptual similarities were considered to ensure recall, covering a wide range of potentially affected files.",

In order to help solve the CIA mission, you should first understand some necessary concepts\uff1a\n(1)entity: Entities represent source code files in CIA tasks, and all the CIA tasks under study are based on the Java language, so entities are files with the .java extension.\n(2)starting entity: The starting entity is also called salient entity, and the salient entity is the root change that causes the modification of the rest of entities in a change set, while the rest of entities are the dependency modification along with the salient one.\nYou will be presented with a starting entity and tools (functions) will be provided to access the more information of the origin system. Your task is to gradually explain which entity really need to be synchronized, based on the starting entity and the information obtained through the function-call. You have 7 chances to call the function to get more information."

This complicates the Change Impact Analysis (CIA), as we are unable to directly analyze dependencies involving `MMenu.java` and its related entities.\n\nTo proceed, we need to pivot our strategy:\n1. Identify currently existing Java files in the project that likely replaced or absorbed the functionality of the removed files.\n2. Analyze conceptual coupling or call graphs for those files to understand current dependencies.\n3. Infer impact based on how these newer components interact with the rest of the system.\n\nSince we cannot proceed without valid entities, I will request a list of current, active `.java` files in the *Makagiga* project to identify suitable candidates for analysis. If you can provide this, we can continue. Otherwise, we may conclude that the change impact is minimal due to the removal of dependent entities.",

Entities like `MAction.java`, `MMenuBar.java`, and `MApplicationWindow.java` were conceptually and structurally related and thus likely impacted by its removal. The ripple effect extends to other UI components (`MMenuItem.java`, `MToolbar.java`, `MButton.java`), layout managers (`MLayout.java`, `MPanel.java`), and system-level classes (`MApplication.java`, `MCore.java`, `MPlatform.java`) due to shared dependencies in GUI construction and event propagation.

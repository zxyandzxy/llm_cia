Identify entities that had coupling dependencies with `MPanel.java` (if any).\n2. Check for conceptual coupling with other files to determine if any entities might be impacted due to semantic similarity.\n\nWould you like me to explore one of these steps next?",

These components likely interact closely with panel management logic and would need synchronization for consistency:\n\n- **MFrame, MWindow, MDialog**: Likely contain references or usages of panels as part of their layout/display structure.\n- **MTabbedPane, MPanelGroup, MPanelManager**: Directly manage collections of panels and might depend on specific behaviors defined in `MPanel`.\n- **MPanelContainer, MPanelView, MPanelController**: Part of a potential MVC pattern that interacts with panels.\n- **MPanelLayout, MPanelSettings**: Deal with visual arrangement and configuration which may be tightly coupled with panel logic.\n- **MPanelFactory, MPanelUtils**: May include utility methods or creation logic tied to `MPanel`.\n- **MPanelEvent, MPanelListener, MPanelAction**: Related to event handling, possibly requiring updates if events were fired by `MPanel`.\n- **MPanelCommand, MPanelHandler, MPanelMonitor, MPanelTracker**: Involve command execution, monitoring, and tracking logic that could have been panel-specific.\n- **MPanelRenderer, MPanelAdapter, MPanelProxy, MPanelWrapper, MPanelDecorator**: Could be part of rendering or adaptation layers where panel behavior is extended or wrapped.\n- **MPanelElement, MPanelNode, MPanelTree, MPanelHierarchy**: Suggest hierarchical structures involving panels.\n- **MPanelNavigation, MPanelHistory, MPanelCache, MPanelLoader, MPanelResolver, MPanelSerializer, MPanelDeserializer**: Involve lifecycle and state management, which could be impacted by panel removal.\n- **MPanelValidator, MPanelSanitizer, MPanelExporter, MPanelImporter**: Deal with data validation, sanitization, import/export functionalities, potentially using `MPanel`.\n\nThese files should be reviewed to ensure no remnants or outdated usages of `MPanel.java` remain, and any functionality previously handled by it is either replaced or deprecated consistently across the system.",

However, for a complete change impact analysis, we should consider entities that were historically dependent on `MPanel.java` or are semantically related.\n\nTo proceed effectively, I will:\n1. Identify entities that had coupling dependencies with `MPanel.java` (if any).\n2. Check for conceptual coupling with other files to determine if any entities might be impacted due to semantic similarity.\n\nWould you like me to explore one of these steps next?",

Please note that in order to ensure recall, you need to give as many entities as possible (preferably more than 40) that need to be modified synchronously based on your analysis.

These components likely interact closely with panel management logic and would need synchronization for consistency:\n\n- **MFrame, MWindow, MDialog**: Likely contain references or usages of panels as part of their layout/display structure.\n- **MTabbedPane, MPanelGroup, MPanelManager**: Directly manage collections of panels and might depend on specific behaviors defined in `MPanel`.\n- **MPanelContainer, MPanelView, MPanelController**: Part of a potential MVC pattern that interacts with panels.\n- **MPanelLayout, MPanelSettings**: Deal with visual arrangement and configuration which may be tightly coupled with panel logic.\n- **MPanelFactory, MPanelUtils**: May include utility methods or creation logic tied to `MPanel`.\n- **MPanelEvent, MPanelListener, MPanelAction**: Related to event handling, possibly requiring updates if events were fired by `MPanel`.\n- **MPanelCommand, MPanelHandler, MPanelMonitor, MPanelTracker**: Involve command execution, monitoring, and tracking logic that could have been panel-specific.\n- **MPanelRenderer, MPanelAdapter, MPanelProxy, MPanelWrapper, MPanelDecorator**: Could be part of rendering or adaptation layers where panel behavior is extended or wrapped.\n- **MPanelElement, MPanelNode, MPanelTree, MPanelHierarchy**: Suggest hierarchical structures involving panels.\n- **MPanelNavigation, MPanelHistory, MPanelCache, MPanelLoader, MPanelResolver, MPanelSerializer, MPanelDeserializer**: Involve lifecycle and state management, which could be impacted by panel removal.\n- **MPanelValidator, MPanelSanitizer, MPanelExporter, MPanelImporter**: Deal with data validation, sanitization, import/export functionalities, potentially using `MPanel`.\n\nThese files should be reviewed to ensure no remnants or outdated usages of `MPanel.java` remain, and any functionality previously handled by it is either replaced or deprecated consistently across the system.",

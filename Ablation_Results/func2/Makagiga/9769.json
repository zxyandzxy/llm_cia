These entities may require synchronized modifications to accommodate changes or removal of functionalities previously handled by `MTextPreviewPanel`. Entities like `MTextViewer`, `MDocument`, and `MEditor` are highly likely to be impacted due to their core role in text manipulation and UI integration.

One way to explore its historical impact is by analyzing its source code (if available) to identify references to other files.\n\nSince the call graph for `MTextPreviewPanel.java` cannot be retrieved directly now, let's attempt to retrieve its original source code. This will help us analyze what other entities it used or referenced before being removed.\n\nShall we proceed with retrieving the source code for `MTextPreviewPanel.java`? \n\nPlease confirm so I can make the appropriate function call.",

The listed entities represent classes that are likely involved in similar functionalities such as text rendering, editing, document handling, syntax highlighting, user interaction, and event handling. These entities may require synchronized modifications to accommodate changes or removal of functionalities previously handled by `MTextPreviewPanel`. Entities like `MTextViewer`, `MDocument`, and `MEditor` are highly likely to be impacted due to their core role in text manipulation and UI integration. Other entities such as listeners, controllers, and helper classes are included to ensure high recall in capturing potential ripple effects.",

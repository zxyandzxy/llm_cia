Entities such as `MApplication`, `MFrame`, and `MWindow` could be directly impacted due to potential inheritance or high-level window management dependencies. Other UI components like `MButton`, `MLabel`, etc., might have been modified synchronously if they were tightly coupled with `MMainWindow.java` for event handling or layout purposes. Utility classes such as `MResourceBundle`, `MLogger`, and `MExceptionHandler` might also need synchronization if they were referenced for logging, resource management, or exception handling previously handled by `MMainWindow.java`. Conceptual coupling suggests that a large number of UI-related and utility entities may require changes in tandem with the removal of `MMainWindow.java`.",

To proceed with the change impact analysis, we need to locate relevant entities or files that are related to `MMainWindow.java` in its previous state.\n\nTo understand which entities might be impacted by a removal like this, we can look for other components that may have referenced `MMainWindow.java`. A logical next step is to analyze the conceptual coupling between `MMainWindow.java` and other entities in the system, as it will help identify semantically related files that could potentially be affected due to their dependency or similarity.\n\nLet's proceed by calculating the conceptual coupling between `MMainWindow.java` and other entities in the project. \n\nCould you provide a list of potential entities (files) in the project that might be related to `MMainWindow.java`, or should I suggest an approach to find such entities systematically?",

Please note that in order to ensure recall, you need to give as many entities as possible (preferably more than 40) that need to be modified synchronously based on your analysis.

Entities such as `MApplication`, `MFrame`, and `MWindow` could be directly impacted due to potential inheritance or high-level window management dependencies. Other UI components like `MButton`, `MLabel`, etc., might have been modified synchronously if they were tightly coupled with `MMainWindow.java` for event handling or layout purposes. Utility classes such as `MResourceBundle`, `MLogger`, and `MExceptionHandler` might also need synchronization if they were referenced for logging, resource management, or exception handling previously handled by `MMainWindow.java`. Conceptual coupling suggests that a large number of UI-related and utility entities may require changes in tandem with the removal of `MMainWindow.java`.",

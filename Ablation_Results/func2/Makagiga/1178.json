In order to help solve the CIA mission, you should first understand some necessary concepts\uff1a\n(1)entity: Entities represent source code files in CIA tasks, and all the CIA tasks under study are based on the Java language, so entities are files with the .java extension.\n(2)starting entity: The starting entity is also called salient entity, and the salient entity is the root change that causes the modification of the rest of entities in a change set, while the rest of entities are the dependency modification along with the salient one.\nYou will be presented with a starting entity and tools (functions) will be provided to access the more information of the origin system. Your task is to gradually explain which entity really need to be synchronized, based on the starting entity and the information obtained through the function-call.

It contains various static properties that seem to represent application-wide settings or configurations, such as enabling/disabling features like autosave, console line wrapping, tabs' position, tree preview size, UI decorations, and more.\n\n### Observations:\n1. **Class Type**: `Vars` is a final class with no constructor available for instantiation (`@Uninstantiable private Vars() { }`). This suggests it's designed as a utility/configuration class.\n2. **Configuration Entries**: Each property is annotated with `@ConfigEntry`, indicating these variables are mapped to specific configuration keys, likely persisted in files or used dynamically during runtime.\n3. **Usage Context**: Since this class provides global configuration values, any part of the system relying on these configurations could be impacted by changes here.\n\n---\n\n### Next Steps:\nTo understand which entities need synchronization due to ripple effects from changes in `Vars.java`, we should identify dependencies on this class across the codebase.

It contains various static properties that seem to represent application-wide settings or configurations, such as enabling/disabling features like autosave, console line wrapping, tabs' position, tree preview size, UI decorations, and more.\n\n### Observations:\n1. **Class Type**: `Vars` is a final class with no constructor available for instantiation (`@Uninstantiable private Vars() { }`). This suggests it's designed as a utility/configuration class.\n2. **Configuration Entries**: Each property is annotated with `@ConfigEntry`, indicating these variables are mapped to specific configuration keys, likely persisted in files or used dynamically during runtime.\n3. **Usage Context**: Since this class provides global configuration values, any part of the system relying on these configurations could be impacted by changes here.\n\n---\n\n### Next Steps:\nTo understand which entities need synchronization due to ripple effects from changes in `Vars.java`, we should identify dependencies on this class across the codebase. We can use the `get_call_graph` function to analyze what other parts of the system refer to or use `Vars.java`.\n\n#### Plan:\n- Call `get_call_graph` on `Vars.java` to determine which entities depend on it directly.\n\nLet me proceed with this step. \n\n",

In order to help solve the CIA mission, you should first understand some necessary concepts\uff1a\n(1)entity: Entities represent source code files in CIA tasks, and all the CIA tasks under study are based on the Java language, so entities are files with the .java extension.\n(2)starting entity: The starting entity is also called salient entity, and the salient entity is the root change that causes the modification of the rest of entities in a change set, while the rest of entities are the dependency modification along with the salient one.\nYou will be presented with a starting entity and tools (functions) will be provided to access the more information of the origin system. Your task is to gradually explain which entity really need to be synchronized, based on the starting entity and the information obtained through the function-call. You have 7 chances to call the function to get more information."

This indicates that changes in `Building.java` might affect how it interacts with `FreeCol.java`.\n\n2. **Messages.java**:\n   - Coupling Dependency Type: Static Method Invoking (SMI)\n   - Details: `Building.java` uses `Messages.message(\"inLocation\", \"%location%\", getName())` to generate localized messages. Any change in this interaction may influence message formatting or behavior.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe entities directly coupled to `Building.java` are `FreeCol.java` and `Messages.java`. These files should be synchronized or reviewed alongside changes to `Building.java` to ensure consistency and correct functionality across dependencies. If you need further details about these files, please let me know!",

In order to help solve the CIA mission, you should first understand some necessary concepts\uff1a\n(1)entity: Entities represent source code files in CIA tasks, and all the CIA tasks under study are based on the Java language, so entities are files with the .java extension.\n(2)starting entity: The starting entity is also called salient entity, and the salient entity is the root change that causes the modification of the rest of entities in a change set, while the rest of entities are the dependency modification along with the salient one.\nYou will be presented with a starting entity and tools (functions) will be provided to access the more information of the origin system.

This indicates that changes in `Building.java` might affect how it interacts with `FreeCol.java`.\n\n2. **Messages.java**:\n   - Coupling Dependency Type: Static Method Invoking (SMI)\n   - Details: `Building.java` uses `Messages.message(\"inLocation\", \"%location%\", getName())` to generate localized messages. Any change in this interaction may influence message formatting or behavior.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe entities directly coupled to `Building.java` are `FreeCol.java` and `Messages.java`. These files should be synchronized or reviewed alongside changes to `Building.java` to ensure consistency and correct functionality across dependencies.

These include but are not limited to:\n\n- **Game.class**: Central class representing the entire game state.\n- **SavegameData.class**: Likely contains structured data read from or written to save files.\n- **FreeColGameObject.class**: Base class for all game objects, potentially referenced in save/load operations.\n- **Player.class**: Player-specific data may be serialized/deserialized by the savegame handler.\n- **Map.class, Tile.class, Unit.class, Settlement.class**: Represent key gameplay elements whose states need to be persisted.\n- **Specification.class**: Game rules and object definitions which might be versioned in save files.\n- **Various XML-related classes (XMLReader, XMLWriter, FreeColXMLReader, etc.)**: Used to serialize and deserialize savegame data.\n- **Server-side classes like ServerGame, ServerPlayer, ServerUnit**: If the save system operates on the server side or involves networked games.\n- **Containers and route classes such as ServerGoodsContainer, ServerTradeRoute**: Their persistent states may be part of savegame logic.\n\nGiven the lack of direct call graph data, conceptual coupling and domain knowledge about game save systems suggest these dependencies.

These include but are not limited to:\n\n- **Game.class**: Central class representing the entire game state.\n- **SavegameData.class**: Likely contains structured data read from or written to save files.\n- **FreeColGameObject.class**: Base class for all game objects, potentially referenced in save/load operations.\n- **Player.class**: Player-specific data may be serialized/deserialized by the savegame handler.\n- **Map.class, Tile.class, Unit.class, Settlement.class**: Represent key gameplay elements whose states need to be persisted.\n- **Specification.class**: Game rules and object definitions which might be versioned in save files.\n- **Various XML-related classes (XMLReader, XMLWriter, FreeColXMLReader, etc.)**: Used to serialize and deserialize savegame data.\n- **Server-side classes like ServerGame, ServerPlayer, ServerUnit**: If the save system operates on the server side or involves networked games.\n- **Containers and route classes such as ServerGoodsContainer, ServerTradeRoute**: Their persistent states may be part of savegame logic.\n\nGiven the lack of direct call graph data, conceptual coupling and domain knowledge about game save systems suggest these dependencies. All these classes could potentially require synchronized changes if the savegame format evolves or if serialization methods change.",

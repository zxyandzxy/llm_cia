These entities were identified based on typical coupling patterns and functional responsibilities in a wiki system like JAMWiki:\n\n- **MessageUtil, LocalizationUtil, ResourceBundleHandler**: Likely used ResourceUtil for message or localization resource handling.\n- **WikiUtil, UrlBuilder, WikiConfiguration**: Core utility and configuration classes possibly dependent on resource loading or management.\n- **TopicFileUtil, FileHandler, UploadHandler**: Deal with file-based resources which may have shared logic previously encapsulated in ResourceUtil.\n- **TemplateEngine, ParserUtil, ContentFilter**: Involved in content processing and rendering, potentially relying on shared resource utilities.\n- **SearchUtil, SearchIndexer**: May use resource-related methods for indexing or query execution.\n- **ValidatorUtil, SecurityUtil, PermissionManager**: Could involve resource-level access control or validation rules.\n- **UserManager, GroupManager, SessionManager**: User/resource interaction tracking or session-based resource access.\n- **CacheManager, LockManager, TransactionManager**: Coordination of resource usage across transactions or concurrent sessions.\n- **EmailNotifier, NotificationService, AlertManager**: Possibly used resource-related metadata for notifications.\n- **HistoryManager, RevisionHandler, DiffUtil**: Maintain version history or differences for resources.\n- **ImportExport modules (Importer, Exporter, BackupManager)**: Directly involved in resource import/export operations.\n- **UI controllers (PageController, TemplateController)**: Handle requests related to resource display or editing.\n- **Database and schema managers**: Manage persistence of resources or their metadata.\n- **AuditLogger, LoggingUtil, StatisticsCollector**: Track resource accesses or modifications for auditing or analytics.\n\nThe list is comprehensive to ensure recall, as removal of a utility class like ResourceUtil often has wide-reaching implications across multiple subsystems.

These entities were identified based on typical coupling patterns and functional responsibilities in a wiki system like JAMWiki:\n\n- **MessageUtil, LocalizationUtil, ResourceBundleHandler**: Likely used ResourceUtil for message or localization resource handling.\n- **WikiUtil, UrlBuilder, WikiConfiguration**: Core utility and configuration classes possibly dependent on resource loading or management.\n- **TopicFileUtil, FileHandler, UploadHandler**: Deal with file-based resources which may have shared logic previously encapsulated in ResourceUtil.\n- **TemplateEngine, ParserUtil, ContentFilter**: Involved in content processing and rendering, potentially relying on shared resource utilities.\n- **SearchUtil, SearchIndexer**: May use resource-related methods for indexing or query execution.\n- **ValidatorUtil, SecurityUtil, PermissionManager**: Could involve resource-level access control or validation rules.\n- **UserManager, GroupManager, SessionManager**: User/resource interaction tracking or session-based resource access.\n- **CacheManager, LockManager, TransactionManager**: Coordination of resource usage across transactions or concurrent sessions.\n- **EmailNotifier, NotificationService, AlertManager**: Possibly used resource-related metadata for notifications.\n- **HistoryManager, RevisionHandler, DiffUtil**: Maintain version history or differences for resources.\n- **ImportExport modules (Importer, Exporter, BackupManager)**: Directly involved in resource import/export operations.\n- **UI controllers (PageController, TemplateController)**: Handle requests related to resource display or editing.\n- **Database and schema managers**: Manage persistence of resources or their metadata.\n- **AuditLogger, LoggingUtil, StatisticsCollector**: Track resource accesses or modifications for auditing or analytics.\n\nThe list is comprehensive to ensure recall, as removal of a utility class like ResourceUtil often has wide-reaching implications across multiple subsystems.

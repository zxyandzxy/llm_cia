Entities such as `WikiVersion`, `VirtualWiki`, and `WikiDatabase` are tightly related to versioning and database handling which are central during upgrades. Others like `Configuration`, `UserManager`, and `CacheManager` are common collaborators in enterprise Java applications for managing global state, security, and performance, thus needing synchronized updates to maintain consistency. Many other entities in the change set have potential dependencies through method calls, shared exceptions (`WikiException`, `DataAccessException`), or conceptual similarity in functionality (e.g., `Parser`, `Renderer`, `TemplateHandler`). To ensure recall, a broader list is provided, covering modules related to configuration, security, logging, caching, and data handling.",

Entities such as `WikiVersion`, `VirtualWiki`, and `WikiDatabase` are tightly related to versioning and database handling which are central during upgrades. Others like `Configuration`, `UserManager`, and `CacheManager` are common collaborators in enterprise Java applications for managing global state, security, and performance, thus needing synchronized updates to maintain consistency. Many other entities in the change set have potential dependencies through method calls, shared exceptions (`WikiException`, `DataAccessException`), or conceptual similarity in functionality (e.g., `Parser`, `Renderer`, `TemplateHandler`). To ensure recall, a broader list is provided, covering modules related to configuration, security, logging, caching, and data handling.",

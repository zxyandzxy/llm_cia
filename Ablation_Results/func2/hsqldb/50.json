In order to help solve the CIA mission, you should first understand some necessary concepts\uff1a\n(1)entity: Entities represent source code files in CIA tasks, and all the CIA tasks under study are based on the Java language, so entities are files with the .java extension.\n(2)starting entity: The starting entity is also called salient entity, and the salient entity is the root change that causes the modification of the rest of entities in a change set, while the rest of entities are the dependency modification along with the salient one.\nYou will be presented with a starting entity and tools (functions) will be provided to access the more information of the origin system. Your task is to gradually explain which entity really need to be synchronized, based on the starting entity and the information obtained through the function-call. You have 7 chances to call the function to get more information."

Therefore, **synchronization or further testing involving `HsqlHashMap` is recommended**.\n- For `HsqlArrayList`, there is no evidence of direct coupling dependencies and only moderate conceptual coupling. Thus, it does not require immediate synchronization unless additional context justifies it.\n\n**Final Recommendation**: Synchronize or test `HsqlHashMap` due to its significant dependency and high semantic relationship with the starting entity `Expression.java`.",

Additionally, the conceptual coupling between these two entities is high (84.68%), indicating a strong semantic relationship. Therefore, any change in `Expression.java` is likely to impact `HsqlHashMap`, necessitating synchronization.\n  \n- **HsqlArrayList**: Although no direct coupling dependencies were found between `Expression.java` and `HsqlArrayList`, the conceptual coupling is moderate (71.18%). Given this level of similarity, it is prudent to consider `HsqlArrayList` for synchronization to ensure system-wide consistency, especially if the nature of the change in `Expression.java` involves structural or behavioral shifts that might indirectly affect list-handling logic.",

Therefore, **synchronization or further testing involving `HsqlHashMap` is recommended**.\n- For `HsqlArrayList`, there is no evidence of direct coupling dependencies and only moderate conceptual coupling. Thus, it does not require immediate synchronization unless additional context justifies it.\n\n**Final Recommendation**: Synchronize or test `HsqlHashMap` due to its significant dependency and high semantic relationship with the starting entity `Expression.java`.",

In order to help solve the CIA mission, you should first understand some necessary concepts\uff1a\n(1)entity: Entities represent source code files in CIA tasks, and all the CIA tasks under study are based on the Java language, so entities are files with the .java extension.\n(2)starting entity: The starting entity is also called salient entity, and the salient entity is the root change that causes the modification of the rest of entities in a change set, while the rest of entities are the dependency modification along with the salient one.\nYou will be presented with a starting entity and tools (functions) will be provided to access the more information of the origin system. Your task is to gradually explain which entity really need to be synchronized, based on the starting entity and the information obtained through the function-call. You have 7 chances to call the function to get more information."

This indicates a strong dependency between `Index.java` and `RowIterator`. Any change in how these methods function or what they return could impact code relying on `RowIterator`.\n\n2. **ArrayUtil**:\n   - Coupling Dependency: Static Method Invoking (SMI)\n   - Explanation: `Index.java` invokes a static method (`intIndexesToBooleanArray`) from `ArrayUtil`. While this does not imply a direct ripple effect in terms of structural change, it shows functional dependence.\n\n### Conclusion\n- **Entities to Synchronize**:\n  - `RowIterator`: Changes in `Index.java` might affect the expected behavior of methods returning `RowIterator`, necessitating synchronization.\n  - `ArrayUtil`: Affects only if the behavior or logic using its static method needs adjustment due to changes in `Index.java`.\n\nIf you'd like, I can analyze further by checking the origin code of `Index.java` to provide more contextual insights into potential ripple effects.

In order to help solve the CIA mission, you should first understand some necessary concepts\uff1a\n(1)entity: Entities represent source code files in CIA tasks, and all the CIA tasks under study are based on the Java language, so entities are files with the .java extension.\n(2)starting entity: The starting entity is also called salient entity, and the salient entity is the root change that causes the modification of the rest of entities in a change set, while the rest of entities are the dependency modification along with the salient one.\nYou will be presented with a starting entity and tools (functions) will be provided to access the more information of the origin system. Your task is to gradually explain which entity really need to be synchronized, based on the starting entity and the information obtained through the function-call.

This indicates a strong dependency between `Index.java` and `RowIterator`. Any change in how these methods function or what they return could impact code relying on `RowIterator`.\n\n2. **ArrayUtil**:\n   - Coupling Dependency: Static Method Invoking (SMI)\n   - Explanation: `Index.java` invokes a static method (`intIndexesToBooleanArray`) from `ArrayUtil`. While this does not imply a direct ripple effect in terms of structural change, it shows functional dependence.\n\n### Conclusion\n- **Entities to Synchronize**:\n  - `RowIterator`: Changes in `Index.java` might affect the expected behavior of methods returning `RowIterator`, necessitating synchronization.\n  - `ArrayUtil`: Affects only if the behavior or logic using its static method needs adjustment due to changes in `Index.java`.\n\nIf you'd like, I can analyze further by checking the origin code of `Index.java` to provide more contextual insights into potential ripple effects.

In order to help solve the CIA mission, you should first understand some necessary concepts\uff1a\n(1)entity: Entities represent source code files in CIA tasks, and all the CIA tasks under study are based on the Java language, so entities are files with the .java extension.\n(2)starting entity: The starting entity is also called salient entity, and the salient entity is the root change that causes the modification of the rest of entities in a change set, while the rest of entities are the dependency modification along with the salient one.\nYou will be presented with a starting entity and tools (functions) will be provided to access the more information of the origin system. Your task is to gradually explain which entity really need to be synchronized, based on the starting entity and the information obtained through the function-call. You have 7 chances to call the function to get more information."

Especially, any change affecting the method signatures, object creation patterns, or data structures used by `TransactionManager.java` could propagate ripple effects to these dependent entities.\n\n### Recommendation:\nThe following entities should be carefully reviewed and potentially synchronized due to their tight coupling with `TransactionManager.java`:\n\n1. **HashMappedList**\n2. **LongKeyIntValueHashMap**\n3. **HsqlArrayList**\n4. **DoubleIntIndex**\n\nThese files are directly referenced and manipulated within `TransactionManager.java`, so they need to remain consistent with its logic and usage patterns.\n\nIf you'd like, I can retrieve the source code for any of these entities to further analyze potential impact points.

A change in how TransactionManager uses this class could affect its behavior elsewhere.  \n- **LongKeyIntValueHashMap**: Heavily used throughout methods like `checkDelete`, `commit`, `rollbackTransactions`, and `addTransaction`. Changes to how keys or values are handled in TransactionManager may require synchronization here.  \n- **HsqlArrayList**: Directly involved in operations within the `checkDelete` method. If data structure handling changes, ripple effects may occur.  \n- **HashMappedList**: Involved in size and key-checking operations in `checkDelete`.

Especially, any change affecting the method signatures, object creation patterns, or data structures used by `TransactionManager.java` could propagate ripple effects to these dependent entities.\n\n### Recommendation:\nThe following entities should be carefully reviewed and potentially synchronized due to their tight coupling with `TransactionManager.java`:\n\n1. **HashMappedList**\n2. **LongKeyIntValueHashMap**\n3. **HsqlArrayList**\n4. **DoubleIntIndex**\n\nThese files are directly referenced and manipulated within `TransactionManager.java`, so they need to remain consistent with its logic and usage patterns.\n\nIf you'd like, I can retrieve the source code for any of these entities to further analyze potential impact points.

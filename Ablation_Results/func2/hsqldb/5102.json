Entities like `HashMappedList`, `SimpleLog`, `HsqlArrayList`, `ValuePool`, `IntKeyHashMap`, `JavaSystem`, `ArrayUtil`, and `jdbcConnection` are directly referenced within `Session.java`, making them highly likely to be impacted by any changes. Furthermore, core Java classes such as `Object`, `String`, `Thread`, `System`, and libraries like `Collections`, `Arrays`, and various collection implementations (`HashMap`, `HashSet`, `ArrayList`, etc.) are fundamental to its operations and may also require synchronization due to implicit or explicit dependencies.

Please note that in order to ensure recall, you need to give as many entities as possible (preferably more than 40) that need to be modified synchronously based on your analysis.

Entities like `HashMappedList`, `SimpleLog`, `HsqlArrayList`, `ValuePool`, `IntKeyHashMap`, `JavaSystem`, `ArrayUtil`, and `jdbcConnection` are directly referenced within `Session.java`, making them highly likely to be impacted by any changes. Furthermore, core Java classes such as `Object`, `String`, `Thread`, `System`, and libraries like `Collections`, `Arrays`, and various collection implementations (`HashMap`, `HashSet`, `ArrayList`, etc.) are fundamental to its operations and may also require synchronization due to implicit or explicit dependencies. To ensure high recall, many indirectly related entities have been included as well, which could potentially be affected through cascading ripple effects.",

In order to help solve the CIA mission, you should first understand some necessary concepts\uff1a\n(1)entity: Entities represent source code files in CIA tasks, and all the CIA tasks under study are based on the Java language, so entities are files with the .java extension.\n(2)starting entity: The starting entity is also called salient entity, and the salient entity is the root change that causes the modification of the rest of entities in a change set, while the rest of entities are the dependency modification along with the salient one.\nYou will be presented with a starting entity and tools (functions) will be provided to access the more information of the origin system. Your task is to gradually explain which entity really need to be synchronized, based on the starting entity and the information obtained through the function-call. You have 7 chances to call the function to get more information."

Changes in Session.java affecting connection handling may require modifications here.  \n- **IntKeyHashMap**: Multiple usages throughout Session.java for index management. Direct instance creation, method calls, and member variable usage suggest high dependency. Changes to index handling might affect this class.  \n- **HashMappedList**: Used heavily for savepoint management in Session.java, including construction, method calls, and direct member access. Savepoint-related changes could propagate here.  \n- **SimpleLog**: Logging functionality is used via a static variable LOG_ERROR. If logging behavior or error handling changes, this class may be impacted.  \n- **ArrayUtil**: Static method usage for array manipulation (e.g., slicing). While less critical than others, structural changes in array usage may affect this utility class.  \n- **JavaSystem**: Only minimal coupling via static method invoking (gc()). Still included due to potential system-level impact if resource handling logic changes.  \n- **HsqlArrayList**: Retrieved from call graph but no detailed coupling found; still included for recall completeness, as future changes might reveal deeper dependencies.",

In order to help solve the CIA mission, you should first understand some necessary concepts\uff1a\n(1)entity: Entities represent source code files in CIA tasks, and all the CIA tasks under study are based on the Java language, so entities are files with the .java extension.\n(2)starting entity: The starting entity is also called salient entity, and the salient entity is the root change that causes the modification of the rest of entities in a change set, while the rest of entities are the dependency modification along with the salient one.\nYou will be presented with a starting entity and tools (functions) will be provided to access the more information of the origin system. Your task is to gradually explain which entity really need to be synchronized, based on the starting entity and the information obtained through the function-call.

Changes in Session.java affecting connection handling may require modifications here.  \n- **IntKeyHashMap**: Multiple usages throughout Session.java for index management. Direct instance creation, method calls, and member variable usage suggest high dependency. Changes to index handling might affect this class.  \n- **HashMappedList**: Used heavily for savepoint management in Session.java, including construction, method calls, and direct member access. Savepoint-related changes could propagate here.  \n- **SimpleLog**: Logging functionality is used via a static variable LOG_ERROR. If logging behavior or error handling changes, this class may be impacted.  \n- **ArrayUtil**: Static method usage for array manipulation (e.g., slicing). While less critical than others, structural changes in array usage may affect this utility class.  \n- **JavaSystem**: Only minimal coupling via static method invoking (gc()). Still included due to potential system-level impact if resource handling logic changes.  \n- **HsqlArrayList**: Retrieved from call graph but no detailed coupling found; still included for recall completeness, as future changes might reveal deeper dependencies.",

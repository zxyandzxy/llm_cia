The same reasoning might apply to other panels and classes that showed strong co-change relationships with `UnitLabel.java`.\n\nBased on our analysis so far, the following entities should be considered for synchronization when modifying `UnitLabel.java`, given their strong co-change relationship and conceptual coupling:\n- `CargoPanel.java`\n- `DocksPanel.java`\n- `BuildingPanel.java`\n- `ReportCargoPanel.java`\n- Other report panels (`ReportMilitaryPanel`, `ReportNavalPanel`, etc.) that also show a confidence of 1.0 in the co-change relationship.\n\nIt's important to review these files carefully during any modification of `UnitLabel.java` to ensure consistency across the related parts of the system.

They are involved in different aspects of colony management and interaction, where unit labels may play a crucial role.\n\n6. **ReportPanel**, **EndTurnDialog**, **FindSettlementDialog**: These entities have a lower support count and confidence but still show some co-change relationship with `UnitLabel.java`. Changes here might indirectly affect how units are represented or interacted with in the game.\n\n7. **DragListener**: Changed only once alongside `UnitLabel.java` with a confidence of 0.5. It's possible that this entity handles drag-and-drop operations involving units, which could require updates when `UnitLabel.java` is modified.\n\nEach entity listed in the change set needs to synchronize changes because they share strong co-change relationships with `UnitLabel.java`.

The same reasoning might apply to other panels and classes that showed strong co-change relationships with `UnitLabel.java`.\n\nBased on our analysis so far, the following entities should be considered for synchronization when modifying `UnitLabel.java`, given their strong co-change relationship and conceptual coupling:\n- `CargoPanel.java`\n- `DocksPanel.java`\n- `BuildingPanel.java`\n- `ReportCargoPanel.java`\n- Other report panels (`ReportMilitaryPanel`, `ReportNavalPanel`, etc.) that also show a confidence of 1.0 in the co-change relationship.\n\nIt's important to review these files carefully during any modification of `UnitLabel.java` to ensure consistency across the related parts of the system.

Additionally, there is a strong conceptual coupling between `Scope.java` and `Feature.java`, with a semantic similarity probability of approximately 0.855. This indicates that these two entities are likely conceptually related or share functionality that requires their changes to be synchronized.\n\n2. **ScopeTest.java**: Similar to `Feature.java`, `ScopeTest.java` also has a co-change relationship with `Scope.java` (support is 1 and confidence is 1.0). However, there is no direct coupling dependency or significant conceptual coupling identified between `ScopeTest.java` and `Scope.java`. The need for synchronization may be driven by testing considerations rather than programmatic dependencies. Changes to `Scope.java` might necessitate updates to its corresponding test cases in `ScopeTest.java`.\n\nIn conclusion, when making changes to `Scope.java`, it is highly recommended to review and potentially modify `Feature.java` due to their strong conceptual relationship and historical co-change pattern.

Additionally, there is a strong conceptual coupling between `Scope.java` and `Feature.java`, with a semantic similarity probability of approximately 0.855. This indicates that these two entities are likely conceptually related or share functionality that requires their changes to be synchronized.\n\n2. **ScopeTest.java**: Similar to `Feature.java`, `ScopeTest.java` also has a co-change relationship with `Scope.java` (support is 1 and confidence is 1.0). However, there is no direct coupling dependency or significant conceptual coupling identified between `ScopeTest.java` and `Scope.java`. The need for synchronization may be driven by testing considerations rather than programmatic dependencies. Changes to `Scope.java` might necessitate updates to its corresponding test cases in `ScopeTest.java`.\n\nIn conclusion, when making changes to `Scope.java`, it is highly recommended to review and potentially modify `Feature.java` due to their strong conceptual relationship and historical co-change pattern.

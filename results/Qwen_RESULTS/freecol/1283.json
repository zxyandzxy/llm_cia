In order to help solve the CIA mission, you should first understand some necessary concepts\uff1a\n(1)entity: Entities represent source code files in CIA tasks, and all the CIA tasks under study are based on the Java language, so entities are files with the .java extension.\n(2)starting entity: The starting entity is also called salient entity, and the salient entity is the root change that causes the modification of the rest of entities in a change set, while the rest of entities are the dependency modification along with the salient one.\nYou will be presented with a starting entity and tools (functions) will be provided to access the more information of the origin system. Your task is to gradually explain which entity really need to be synchronized, based on the starting entity and the information obtained through the function-call. You have 7 chances to call the function to get more information."

This indicates that whenever changes were made to `River.java` in the past, `MapGenerator.java` was also modified. Therefore, it is highly likely that any modifications to `River.java` will require corresponding changes in `MapGenerator.java`.\n\n- `Tile.java`: Co-change analysis shows a support count of 1 and a confidence level of 0.5 for `Tile.java`. While there are no direct coupling dependencies, it's possible that `Tile.java` may need adjustments when `River.java` is changed due to their historical co-modification patterns.\n\n- `ImageLibrary.java`: Similar to `Tile.java`, `ImageLibrary.java` has been co-changed with `River.java` once, resulting in a confidence level of 0.5. There are no direct code interdependencies, but given the co-change history, it should be reviewed for potential necessary updates.\n\n- `GUI.java`: With a support count of 1 and a confidence level of 0.5, `GUI.java` has also been co-changed alongside `River.java`. Even though there are no coupling dependencies detected, this file should be considered as part of the change set based on past modification trends.\n\nPlease note that `TerrainGenerator.java` has been removed from the project and is therefore not included in the change set. Additionally, the call graph analysis identified `Tile.java` and `Map.java` as entities called or referenced by `River.java`, suggesting these might need to be synchronized as well.

In order to help solve the CIA mission, you should first understand some necessary concepts\uff1a\n(1)entity: Entities represent source code files in CIA tasks, and all the CIA tasks under study are based on the Java language, so entities are files with the .java extension.\n(2)starting entity: The starting entity is also called salient entity, and the salient entity is the root change that causes the modification of the rest of entities in a change set, while the rest of entities are the dependency modification along with the salient one.\nYou will be presented with a starting entity and tools (functions) will be provided to access the more information of the origin system. Your task is to gradually explain which entity really need to be synchronized, based on the starting entity and the information obtained through the function-call.

This indicates that whenever changes were made to `River.java` in the past, `MapGenerator.java` was also modified. Therefore, it is highly likely that any modifications to `River.java` will require corresponding changes in `MapGenerator.java`.\n\n- `Tile.java`: Co-change analysis shows a support count of 1 and a confidence level of 0.5 for `Tile.java`. While there are no direct coupling dependencies, it's possible that `Tile.java` may need adjustments when `River.java` is changed due to their historical co-modification patterns.\n\n- `ImageLibrary.java`: Similar to `Tile.java`, `ImageLibrary.java` has been co-changed with `River.java` once, resulting in a confidence level of 0.5. There are no direct code interdependencies, but given the co-change history, it should be reviewed for potential necessary updates.\n\n- `GUI.java`: With a support count of 1 and a confidence level of 0.5, `GUI.java` has also been co-changed alongside `River.java`. Even though there are no coupling dependencies detected, this file should be considered as part of the change set based on past modification trends.\n\nPlease note that `TerrainGenerator.java` has been removed from the project and is therefore not included in the change set.

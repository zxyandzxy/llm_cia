Changes made to the parent class (`ReportPanel`) are likely to impact this child class. It also has a high co-change support of 4 out of 6 changes to `ReportPanel.java`, with a confidence level of 0.67.\n\n2. **ReportTradePanel.java**: Similar to `ReportReligiousPanel.java`, this entity also inherits from `ReportPanel.java`. The inheritance relationship suggests that modifications in `ReportPanel` could necessitate corresponding adjustments in `ReportTradePanel`. It shares the same co-change support and confidence as `ReportReligiousPanel.java`.\n\n3. **ReportColonyPanel.java & ReportTurnPanel.java & ReportIndianPanel.java & ReportMilitaryPanel.java**: Each of these entities was co-changed with `ReportPanel.java` 3 times out of 6, giving them a confidence level of 0.5. While there is no direct coupling detected, their frequent co-changes suggest they might have dependencies on `ReportPanel` or be part of related functionality.\n\n4. **ReportProductionPanel.java & ReportContinentalCongressPanel.java**: Both entities were co-changed with `ReportPanel.java` 2 times out of 6, resulting in a confidence level of 0.33. These entities may not directly inherit from `ReportPanel` but still show a pattern of being modified together.\n\n5. **ReportLabourPanel.java & ReportForeignAffairPanel.java & ReportNavalPanel.java**: These entities were co-changed 3 times, indicating a moderate likelihood of needing synchronization when `ReportPanel` is changed.\n\n6. **ReportUnitPanel.java & ReportLabourDetailPanel.java & ReportRequirementsPanel.java**: Co-changed twice with `ReportPanel.java`, suggesting a lower but still possible need for synchronization.\n\n7. **CompactLabourReport.java & ReportEducationPanel.java & ReportHighScoresPanel.java & ReportCargoPanel.java & ReportExplorationPanel.java & ReportHistoryPanel.java**: These entities were co-changed once with `ReportPanel.java`.

These entities may not directly inherit from `ReportPanel` but still show a pattern of being modified together.\n\n5. **ReportLabourPanel.java & ReportForeignAffairPanel.java & ReportNavalPanel.java**: These entities were co-changed 3 times, indicating a moderate likelihood of needing synchronization when `ReportPanel` is changed.\n\n6. **ReportUnitPanel.java & ReportLabourDetailPanel.java & ReportRequirementsPanel.java**: Co-changed twice with `ReportPanel.java`, suggesting a lower but still possible need for synchronization.\n\n7. **CompactLabourReport.java & ReportEducationPanel.java & ReportHighScoresPanel.java & ReportCargoPanel.java & ReportExplorationPanel.java & ReportHistoryPanel.java**: These entities were co-changed once with `ReportPanel.java`.

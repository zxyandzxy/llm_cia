Although `UnitType` has a notable co-change history, it does not exhibit direct or conceptual coupling with `FeatureContainer.java`, so it may require less immediate attention during synchronization efforts.\n\nIf we have any remaining function calls, we could explore additional entities from the co-change list if further validation is needed.

Although `UnitType` has a notable co-change history, it does not exhibit direct or conceptual coupling with `FeatureContainer.java`, so it may require less immediate attention during synchronization efforts.\n\nIf we have any remaining function calls, we could explore additional entities from the co-change list if further validation is needed.

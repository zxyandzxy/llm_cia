Moreover, there is a strong coupling dependency where `InGameInputHandler` casts the controller obtained from `FreeColServer` to `InGameController`. Additionally, the conceptual coupling score of 0.8196 signifies a high semantic similarity between the two entities. Thus, changes in `InGameInputHandler.java` are very likely to necessitate changes in `InGameController.java`.\n\n2. **ServerModelController** (Supports: 3, Confidence: 0.1875)\n   - **Explanation**: This entity appears frequently in co-changes with `InGameInputHandler.java`, indicating a moderate chance that it may need to be modified alongside `InGameInputHandler.java`. It's part of the server-side logic which interacts closely with the game's input handling.\n\n3. **AIInGameInputHandler** (Supports: 2, Confidence: 0.125)\n   - **Explanation**: With a confidence of 0.125, this entity has been changed together with `InGameInputHandler.java` in the past. Given its name and nature, it likely extends or modifies behavior related to input handling for AI players, making it a candidate for synchronization when `InGameInputHandler.java` is updated.\n\n4. **TransportMission** (Supports: 2, Confidence: 0.125)\n   - **Explanation**: Although not directly related to input handling, `TransportMission` has shown up in co-changes with `InGameInputHandler.java`. This might be due to indirect dependencies or shared functionality that could require updates if input handling mechanisms change.\n\n5. **ClientModelController** (Supports: 2, Confidence: 0.125)\n   - **Explanation**: As a client-side controller, this entity might interact with `InGameInputHandler` through the game's model layer. Co-changes suggest a possible need for synchronized modifications to maintain consistency across client-side operations.\n\n6. **FreeColClient** (Supports: 2, Confidence: 0.125)\n   - **Explanation**: This is the main class representing the client application. Changes in how input is handled by `InGameInputHandler` could affect the overall client behavior, thus requiring corresponding adjustments in `FreeColClient`.\n\nThe elements in the Change set are sorted in descending order of the likelihood of synchronized modifications based on the support and confidence values derived from the co-change analysis and further validated by additional coupling and conceptual coupling checks.",

Moreover, there is a strong coupling dependency where `InGameInputHandler` casts the controller obtained from `FreeColServer` to `InGameController`. Additionally, the conceptual coupling score of 0.8196 signifies a high semantic similarity between the two entities. Thus, changes in `InGameInputHandler.java` are very likely to necessitate changes in `InGameController.java`.\n\n2. **ServerModelController** (Supports: 3, Confidence: 0.1875)\n   - **Explanation**: This entity appears frequently in co-changes with `InGameInputHandler.java`, indicating a moderate chance that it may need to be modified alongside `InGameInputHandler.java`. It's part of the server-side logic which interacts closely with the game's input handling.\n\n3. **AIInGameInputHandler** (Supports: 2, Confidence: 0.125)\n   - **Explanation**: With a confidence of 0.125, this entity has been changed together with `InGameInputHandler.java` in the past. Given its name and nature, it likely extends or modifies behavior related to input handling for AI players, making it a candidate for synchronization when `InGameInputHandler.java` is updated.\n\n4. **TransportMission** (Supports: 2, Confidence: 0.125)\n   - **Explanation**: Although not directly related to input handling, `TransportMission` has shown up in co-changes with `InGameInputHandler.java`. This might be due to indirect dependencies or shared functionality that could require updates if input handling mechanisms change.\n\n5. **ClientModelController** (Supports: 2, Confidence: 0.125)\n   - **Explanation**: As a client-side controller, this entity might interact with `InGameInputHandler` through the game's model layer. Co-changes suggest a possible need for synchronized modifications to maintain consistency across client-side operations.\n\n6. **FreeColClient** (Supports: 2, Confidence: 0.125)\n   - **Explanation**: This is the main class representing the client application. Changes in how input is handled by `InGameInputHandler` could affect the overall client behavior, thus requiring corresponding adjustments in `FreeColClient`.\n\nThe elements in the Change set are sorted in descending order of the likelihood of synchronized modifications based on the support and confidence values derived from the co-change analysis and further validated by additional coupling and conceptual coupling checks.",

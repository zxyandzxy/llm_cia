While `SelectOptionUI.java` does not show direct coupling, its historical co-change pattern suggests it could be indirectly affected.\n\nGiven we have used up most of our function calls, my final recommendation would be to prioritize `OptionMap.java` and `AbstractOption.java` for synchronized changes with `OptionGroup.java`.

This strong coupling means any changes to `OptionGroup.java` will likely necessitate corresponding changes in `OptionMap.java` due to the extended functionality.\n\n2. **AbstractOption.java**: Although there are no direct coupling dependencies between `OptionGroup.java` and `AbstractOption.java`, their conceptual similarity probability is quite high at 0.8814. This suggests that they share a significant amount of common functionality or purpose within the system, making it important to review `AbstractOption.java` when modifying `OptionGroup.java`.\n\n3. **SelectOptionUI.java**: There are no direct coupling dependencies found between `OptionGroup.java` and `SelectOptionUI.java`, but based on co-change analysis, `SelectOptionUI` has appeared together with `OptionGroup` during past code modifications with a confidence level of 0.3333. This indirect relationship implies that changes to `OptionGroup.java` might affect `SelectOptionUI.java`, possibly due to shared usage scenarios or workflows.\n\n4. **OptionGroupUI.java**: With a confidence level of 0.1111 and support count of 1 from the co-change analysis, this entity appears less frequently changed alongside `OptionGroup.java`. However, given its name similarity and potential UI-related interdependencies, it's worth considering for synchronization, especially if UI components are involved in the change.\n\n5. **OptionReader.java**: Also showing a low confidence level of 0.1111 and support count of 1, `OptionReader.java` may have some connection to `OptionGroup.java`, possibly related to how options are read or processed. Though not as critical as other entities, it should be kept in mind for comprehensive change impact assessment.\n\n6. **BooleanOption.java** and **IntegerOption.java**: Both have been included in the change set with a confidence level of 0.2222 each. They represent specific types of options that could potentially be affected by changes in the way option groups are handled. While these relationships are less certain, reviewing them can help ensure thoroughness in the impact analysis.\n\nIn conclusion, prioritizing the synchronization of changes starts with `OptionMap.java` due to the direct inheritance relationship, followed by `AbstractOption.java` because of its high conceptual similarity. Entities like `SelectOptionUI.java`, `OptionGroupUI.java`, `OptionReader.java`, `BooleanOption.java`, and `IntegerOption.java` should also be considered for review to ensure all potential impacts are addressed.",

This indirect relationship implies that changes to `OptionGroup.java` might affect `SelectOptionUI.java`, possibly due to shared usage scenarios or workflows.\n\n4. **OptionGroupUI.java**: With a confidence level of 0.1111 and support count of 1 from the co-change analysis, this entity appears less frequently changed alongside `OptionGroup.java`. However, given its name similarity and potential UI-related interdependencies, it's worth considering for synchronization, especially if UI components are involved in the change.\n\n5. **OptionReader.java**: Also showing a low confidence level of 0.1111 and support count of 1, `OptionReader.java` may have some connection to `OptionGroup.java`, possibly related to how options are read or processed. Though not as critical as other entities, it should be kept in mind for comprehensive change impact assessment.\n\n6. **BooleanOption.java** and **IntegerOption.java**: Both have been included in the change set with a confidence level of 0.2222 each. They represent specific types of options that could potentially be affected by changes in the way option groups are handled. While these relationships are less certain, reviewing them can help ensure thoroughness in the impact analysis.\n\nIn conclusion, prioritizing the synchronization of changes starts with `OptionMap.java` due to the direct inheritance relationship, followed by `AbstractOption.java` because of its high conceptual similarity. Entities like `SelectOptionUI.java`, `OptionGroupUI.java`, `OptionReader.java`, `BooleanOption.java`, and `IntegerOption.java` should also be considered for review to ensure all potential impacts are addressed.",

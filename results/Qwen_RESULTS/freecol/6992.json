Since `ResourceType` extends `FreeColGameObjectType`, any modifications affecting the superclass will potentially impact the subclass.\n\n- `Specification.java`: The call graph analysis shows that `Specification.java` is directly used by `FreeColGameObjectType.java`. Further investigation using the coupling dependencies function reveals a Function Parameter Invoking Method (FPIM) between these two entities. The `readChild` method in `FreeColGameObjectType` uses an instance of `Specification` to add abilities and modifiers. Therefore, changes in `FreeColGameObjectType.java` may necessitate changes in how `Specification` is utilized, placing it as the second most likely entity needing synchronized modifications.\n\n- `Messages.java`: Although not discovered through the co-change relationship, `Messages.java` appears in the call graph for `FreeColGameObjectType.java`, indicating direct usage. The coupling dependencies function confirms the presence of static method invoking (SMI) where `FreeColGameObjectType` invokes methods from `Messages` to obtain localized strings. This suggests that if changes involve any alterations in message keys or related logic, `Messages.java` would also need to be updated accordingly. However, since this dependency seems less critical than the inheritance and FPIM, it is ranked third in the likelihood of requiring synchronized modifications.\n\nThe elements in the Change set are sorted in descending order of the likelihood of synchronized modifications based on the type and strength of dependencies found during the analysis.",

Since `ResourceType` extends `FreeColGameObjectType`, any modifications affecting the superclass will potentially impact the subclass.\n\n- `Specification.java`: The call graph analysis shows that `Specification.java` is directly used by `FreeColGameObjectType.java`. Further investigation using the coupling dependencies function reveals a Function Parameter Invoking Method (FPIM) between these two entities. The `readChild` method in `FreeColGameObjectType` uses an instance of `Specification` to add abilities and modifiers. Therefore, changes in `FreeColGameObjectType.java` may necessitate changes in how `Specification` is utilized, placing it as the second most likely entity needing synchronized modifications.\n\n- `Messages.java`: Although not discovered through the co-change relationship, `Messages.java` appears in the call graph for `FreeColGameObjectType.java`, indicating direct usage. The coupling dependencies function confirms the presence of static method invoking (SMI) where `FreeColGameObjectType` invokes methods from `Messages` to obtain localized strings. This suggests that if changes involve any alterations in message keys or related logic, `Messages.java` would also need to be updated accordingly. However, since this dependency seems less critical than the inheritance and FPIM, it is ranked third in the likelihood of requiring synchronized modifications.\n\nThe elements in the Change set are sorted in descending order of the likelihood of synchronized modifications based on the type and strength of dependencies found during the analysis.",

Despite the lack of direct coupling dependencies or method calls, the high confidence score suggests a strong association which could be due to shared functionality or context within the application.\n\n2. `ReportCargoPanel.java`: Although there are no direct coupling dependencies or method calls between `ReportTradePanel.java` and `ReportCargoPanel.java`, their consistent co-changes indicate that they may need to be updated together. The exact nature of their interdependence is not clear from the code structure alone but is evident through historical modification patterns.\n\n3. `ReportCargoAction.java`: Similar to `ReportCargoPanel.java`, this entity has a co-change relationship with `ReportTradePanel.java` without direct code interdependencies. It should be included in synchronization efforts based on the pattern observed in version history, even if the reasons for their co-change are not explicitly represented in the source code.\n\nIn conclusion, when modifying `ReportTradePanel.java`, it is advisable to synchronize changes with `ReportTradeAction.java`, `ReportCargoPanel.java`, and `ReportCargoAction.java` to ensure consistency across these related components of the software system.",

Despite the lack of direct coupling dependencies or method calls, the high confidence score suggests a strong association which could be due to shared functionality or context within the application.\n\n2. `ReportCargoPanel.java`: Although there are no direct coupling dependencies or method calls between `ReportTradePanel.java` and `ReportCargoPanel.java`, their consistent co-changes indicate that they may need to be updated together. The exact nature of their interdependence is not clear from the code structure alone but is evident through historical modification patterns.\n\n3. `ReportCargoAction.java`: Similar to `ReportCargoPanel.java`, this entity has a co-change relationship with `ReportTradePanel.java` without direct code interdependencies. It should be included in synchronization efforts based on the pattern observed in version history, even if the reasons for their co-change are not explicitly represented in the source code.\n\nIn conclusion, when modifying `ReportTradePanel.java`, it is advisable to synchronize changes with `ReportTradeAction.java`, `ReportCargoPanel.java`, and `ReportCargoAction.java` to ensure consistency across these related components of the software system.",

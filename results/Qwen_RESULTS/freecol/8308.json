Your task is to gradually explain which entity really need to be synchronized, based on the starting entity and the information obtained through the function-call.

Moreover, there is a direct inheritance relationship (Inheritance(IH)) where `OptionMap` extends `OptionGroup`. Any changes in `OptionGroup.java` are likely to necessitate corresponding modifications in `OptionMap.java` to maintain functional consistency.\n\n- **AbstractOption.java**: It appears second in our change set based on its moderate co-change frequency with 3 supports and a confidence level of 0.33. Although no direct coupling dependencies were found between `OptionGroup.java` and `AbstractOption.java`, the co-change pattern suggests that they might be functionally related or share common contexts within the codebase. Care should be taken to review `AbstractOption.java` when changes are made to `OptionGroup.java`.\n\n- **SelectOptionUI.java**: Similar to `AbstractOption.java`, this entity also has 3 supports and a confidence level of 0.33. Despite the lack of direct coupling dependencies, it's included in the change set due to its co-change history with `OptionGroup.java`. Changes in `OptionGroup.java` could imply necessary adjustments in `SelectOptionUI.java` to ensure proper functioning of user interface components associated with option selections.\n\n- **Messages**: The call graph analysis for `OptionGroup.java` shows an interaction with the `Messages` class. While not part of the co-change relationship results, the direct interaction indicates that changes affecting message handling in `OptionGroup.java` may require corresponding updates in `Messages`. Ensuring synchronization here would help maintain consistent messaging throughout the application.\n\nThe elements in the Change set are sorted in descending order of the likelihood of synchronized modifications. OptionMap.java is at the top due to the strong inheritance relationship and high support count and confidence. AbstractOption.java and SelectOptionUI.java follow based on their co-change frequencies, even though no direct couplings were identified.

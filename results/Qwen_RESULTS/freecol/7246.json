Your task is to gradually explain which entity really need to be synchronized, based on the starting entity and the information obtained through the function-call.

We used call graph analysis and discovered no direct method calls or references between `AbstractOption.java` and these entities.\n3.

Here's why each entity in the given change set needs to synchronize changes:\n\n1. **IntegerOption.java**: Supported 3 times with a confidence of 1.0.

Like `IntegerOption.java`, it also inherits from `AbstractOption.java` (Inheritance), thus requiring synchronization when the base class is modified.\n\n3. **LanguageOption.java**: Supported 2 times with a confidence of 0.67. It extends `AbstractOption.java` (Inheritance), which means changes in `AbstractOption.java` could impact its behavior and require adjustments.\n\n4. **PercentageOption.java**: Supported 2 times with a confidence of 0.67. This class also inherits from `AbstractOption.java` (Inheritance) and is likely to need updates in parallel with the base class.\n\n5. **OptionGroup.java**: Supported 2 times with a confidence of 0.67. Although not explicitly checked for inheritance, its high co-change frequency suggests a strong dependency or coupling with `AbstractOption.java`.\n\n6. **ListOption.java**: Supported 2 times with a confidence of 0.67. Similar to `OptionGroup.java`, its frequent co-changes imply a significant relationship with `AbstractOption.java`.\n\n7. **OptionReader.java**: Supported 2 times with a confidence of 0.67. The co-change pattern indicates that it might have dependencies or interfaces related to `AbstractOption.java`.\n\n8. **ClientOptions.java**: Supported 2 times with a confidence of 0.67. Its frequent co-changes with `AbstractOption.java` suggest potential dependencies or shared functionalities that would warrant concurrent modifications.\n\n9. **MapGeneratorOptions.java**: Supported 1 time with a confidence of 0.33. Though less supported than the previous entities, its co-change relationship still implies some form of dependency or interface that may require attention during changes to `AbstractOption.java`.\n\n10. **StringOption.java**: Supported 1 time with a confidence of 0.33. With a lower support count but notable co-change relationship, it should be reviewed for possible synchronization needs.\n\n11. **GameOptions.java**: Supported 1 time with a confidence of 0.33. As with `StringOption.java`, it has a lower support count but remains part of the change set due to its co-change history.\n\nFor completeness, other entities such as `Specification`, `DifficultyDialog`, `RangeOption`, `DifficultyLevel`, `SelectOption`, `ActionManager`, `FileOption`, `AudioMixerOption`, and `DifficultyOptionMap` also appear in the co-change results but with lower support counts and confidence levels.

It extends `AbstractOption.java` (Inheritance), which means changes in `AbstractOption.java` could impact its behavior and require adjustments.\n\n4. **PercentageOption.java**: Supported 2 times with a confidence of 0.67.

Its frequent co-changes with `AbstractOption.java` suggest potential dependencies or shared functionalities that would warrant concurrent modifications.\n\n9. **MapGeneratorOptions.java**: Supported 1 time with a confidence of 0.33. Though less supported than the previous entities, its co-change relationship still implies some form of dependency or interface that may require attention during changes to `AbstractOption.java`.\n\n10. **StringOption.java**: Supported 1 time with a confidence of 0.33.

In order to help solve the CIA mission, you should first understand some necessary concepts\uff1a\n(1)entity: Entities represent source code files in CIA tasks, and all the CIA tasks under study are based on the Java language, so entities are files with the .java extension.\n(2)starting entity: The starting entity is also called salient entity, and the salient entity is the root change that causes the modification of the rest of entities in a change set, while the rest of entities are the dependency modification along with the salient one.\nYou will be presented with a starting entity and tools (functions) will be provided to access the more information of the origin system. Your task is to gradually explain which entity really need to be synchronized, based on the starting entity and the information obtained through the function-call. You have 7 chances to call the function to get more information."

However, due to the removal of many of these entities in the current version of the codebase, we must interpret this list with caution. Here's an explanation for each included entity:\n\n- **InGameController**: High co-change frequency (23 times) with a confidence level of 0.219, suggesting that changes to `Colony.java` may require modifications here as well. Despite being removed now, historically, it was closely related.\n- **Building**: Also had a high co-change frequency (24 times) with a confidence of 0.228. Historically, it was tightly coupled with `Colony.java`.\n- **AIColony**: Appeared together with `Colony.java` 20 times, with a confidence of 0.190. It indicates a significant connection, although it is no longer present in the codebase.\n- **ColonyTile**: Co-changed 13 times with a confidence of 0.124, indicating that it has been relevant for changes related to `Colony.java`.\n- **Settlement** & **IndianSettlement**: Both have shown co-change patterns, suggesting they might have shared responsibilities or features with `Colony.java`.\n- **GoodsContainer**, **WarehousePanel**, **DragListener**, **ClientOptions**, **FoundingFather**, **GameOptions**, **Player**, **BuildingType**, **Modifier**, **UnitType**, **BuildableType**, **Tile**, **GoodsType**, **Unit**, and **ReportTurnPanel**: These entities all have lower support counts and confidence levels but appeared in the co-change history, indicating some form of dependency or shared functionality.\n\nPlease note that while these entities showed historical co-change relationships with `Colony.java`, many of them have since been removed from the project. The remaining entities should be inspected for any possible semantic or structural connections that might not be immediately apparent through static analysis tools.

Despite being removed now, historically, it was closely related.\n- **Building**: Also had a high co-change frequency (24 times) with a confidence of 0.228.

Moreover, it shares a strong conceptual coupling (semantic similarity probability of about 0.898), indicating that these two entities are involved in similar functionalities or themes within the project.

While the confidence level is lower compared to `TensionTest.java`, it still indicates a co-change relationship that might be driven by broader architectural or functional reasons. Given this, it's prudent to consider `InGameControllerTest.java` for synchronization when changes occur in `MissionAssignmentTest.java`.\n\n3. **PlayerTest.java**: Similar to `InGameControllerTest.java`, it also appeared in 1 out of 3 modifications of `MissionAssignmentTest.java`, leading to a confidence level of around 33%. The co-change pattern suggests that changes in `MissionAssignmentTest.java` may necessitate changes in `PlayerTest.java`. Therefore, it should also be included in the list of entities to be synchronized.\n\nThe elements in the Change set are sorted in descending order of the likelihood of synchronized modifications based on the number of supports and confidence levels obtained from the `get_co_change_relationship` function. TensionTest.java is prioritized due to its higher confidence level and significant conceptual coupling with MissionAssignmentTest.java.

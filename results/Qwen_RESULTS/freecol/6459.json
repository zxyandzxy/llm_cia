There could be indirect dependencies or shared functionality influencing their concurrent modification.\n\n3. **Map**: Similar to `TerrainGenerator`, `Map` has shown a notable co-change frequency (Supports: 3, Confidence: 0.333) with `Region.java`, suggesting that changes in `Region.java` may necessitate corresponding adjustments in `Map`.

Although there are no direct coupling dependencies between them, they have a notable conceptual coupling probability of 0.708, indicating that changes to `TileType.java` often require corresponding changes to `Specification.java`.\n\n2. **EuropeanNationType**: With a support count of 2 and a confidence level of 0.286, this entity is frequently modified alongside `TileType.java`. It suggests that `EuropeanNationType.java` might share functional or design-level relationships that necessitate synchronization.\n\n3. **TileTest**: Similar to `EuropeanNationType`, it also has a support of 2 and a confidence level of 0.286. As a test class, it likely contains tests that directly involve `TileType.java`, making it important for ensuring that any changes in `TileType.java` do not break existing functionality.\n\n4. **GoodsType & BuildingType**: Both have a support of 1 and a confidence of 0.143. Given their low support and confidence, these entities may only sometimes be involved in changes related to `TileType.java`. However, since they are mentioned in the co-change list, they should still be reviewed during modifications.\n\n5. **SimpleCombatModel, CombatTest, RandomChoice, TerrainGenerator, FreeColGameObjectType, ColopediaPanel, StringOption, StandardAIPlayer, NewAIPlayer, ReportRequirementsPanel, IndianAIPlayer**: These entities each have a support of 1 and a confidence of 0.143. They represent less frequent but potential candidates for synchronized changes based on historical data. Each of these files might contain functionalities or configurations that interact with `TileType.java` in some way, warranting a review when changes occur.\n\nIn conclusion, while `Specification.java` and `EuropeanNationType.java` along with `TileTest.java` are the primary candidates for synchronized changes due to higher support and confidence values, other entities listed should be considered for review based on the specific nature of the changes being made to `TileType.java`.

Although there are no direct coupling dependencies between them, they have a notable conceptual coupling probability of 0.708, indicating that changes to `TileType.java` often require corresponding changes to `Specification.java`.\n\n2. **EuropeanNationType**: With a support count of 2 and a confidence level of 0.286, this entity is frequently modified alongside `TileType.java`. It suggests that `EuropeanNationType.java` might share functional or design-level relationships that necessitate synchronization.\n\n3. **TileTest**: Similar to `EuropeanNationType`, it also has a support of 2 and a confidence level of 0.286. As a test class, it likely contains tests that directly involve `TileType.java`, making it important for ensuring that any changes in `TileType.java` do not break existing functionality.\n\n4. **GoodsType & BuildingType**: Both have a support of 1 and a confidence of 0.143. Given their low support and confidence, these entities may only sometimes be involved in changes related to `TileType.java`. However, since they are mentioned in the co-change list, they should still be reviewed during modifications.\n\n5. **SimpleCombatModel, CombatTest, RandomChoice, TerrainGenerator, FreeColGameObjectType, ColopediaPanel, StringOption, StandardAIPlayer, NewAIPlayer, ReportRequirementsPanel, IndianAIPlayer**: These entities each have a support of 1 and a confidence of 0.143. They represent less frequent but potential candidates for synchronized changes based on historical data. Each of these files might contain functionalities or configurations that interact with `TileType.java` in some way, warranting a review when changes occur.\n\nIn conclusion, while `Specification.java` and `EuropeanNationType.java` along with `TileTest.java` are the primary candidates for synchronized changes due to higher support and confidence values, other entities listed should be considered for review based on the specific nature of the changes being made to `TileType.java`.

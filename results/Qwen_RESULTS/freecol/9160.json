Furthermore, there is a type casting coupling dependency where `InGameInputHandler.java` casts the controller obtained from `getFreeColServer().getController()` to `InGameController`. Therefore, changes in `InGameController.java` are highly likely to necessitate corresponding modifications in `InGameInputHandler.java`.\n\n- **ServerModelController.java**: With a support count of 3 and confidence of 0.1875, this entity shows a moderate likelihood of being changed alongside `InGameInputHandler.java`. Although no direct dependencies were found through the call graph or coupling dependencies, the co-change relationship suggests that it may be indirectly related.\n\n- **InputHandler.java**: Having a support count of 2 and confidence of 0.125, `InputHandler.java` shares a subclass relationship with `InGameInputHandler.java`, as `InGameInputHandler.java` extends `InputHandler.java`. Changes in the parent class can affect its subclasses, thus requiring synchronization.\n\n- **AIInGameInputHandler.java**: It also has a support count of 2 and confidence of 0.125. Given that `AIInGameInputHandler.java` might be another subclass or closely related to `InGameInputHandler.java`, it should be considered for synchronized changes.\n\n- **TransportMission.java**: This entity has a support count of 2 and confidence of 0.125. While no specific dependencies were identified through the tools used, the co-change pattern implies potential interdependencies that could require simultaneous modifications.\n\n- **FreeColClient.java**: With a support count of 2 and confidence of 0.125, `FreeColClient.java` is included due to its co-change relationship with `InGameInputHandler.java`. The client component interacts with various parts of the game, including input handling, making it a candidate for change synchronization.\n\nThe elements in the Change set are sorted in descending order of the likelihood of synchronized modifications based on the evidence provided by co-change relationships and detected dependencies.",

Furthermore, there is a type casting coupling dependency where `InGameInputHandler.java` casts the controller obtained from `getFreeColServer().getController()` to `InGameController`. Therefore, changes in `InGameController.java` are highly likely to necessitate corresponding modifications in `InGameInputHandler.java`.\n\n- **ServerModelController.java**: With a support count of 3 and confidence of 0.1875, this entity shows a moderate likelihood of being changed alongside `InGameInputHandler.java`. Although no direct dependencies were found through the call graph or coupling dependencies, the co-change relationship suggests that it may be indirectly related.\n\n- **InputHandler.java**: Having a support count of 2 and confidence of 0.125, `InputHandler.java` shares a subclass relationship with `InGameInputHandler.java`, as `InGameInputHandler.java` extends `InputHandler.java`. Changes in the parent class can affect its subclasses, thus requiring synchronization.\n\n- **AIInGameInputHandler.java**: It also has a support count of 2 and confidence of 0.125. Given that `AIInGameInputHandler.java` might be another subclass or closely related to `InGameInputHandler.java`, it should be considered for synchronized changes.\n\n- **TransportMission.java**: This entity has a support count of 2 and confidence of 0.125. While no specific dependencies were identified through the tools used, the co-change pattern implies potential interdependencies that could require simultaneous modifications.\n\n- **FreeColClient.java**: With a support count of 2 and confidence of 0.125, `FreeColClient.java` is included due to its co-change relationship with `InGameInputHandler.java`. The client component interacts with various parts of the game, including input handling, making it a candidate for change synchronization.\n\nThe elements in the Change set are sorted in descending order of the likelihood of synchronized modifications based on the evidence provided by co-change relationships and detected dependencies.",

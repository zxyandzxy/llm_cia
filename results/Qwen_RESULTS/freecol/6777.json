In order to help solve the CIA mission, you should first understand some necessary concepts\uff1a\n(1)entity: Entities represent source code files in CIA tasks, and all the CIA tasks under study are based on the Java language, so entities are files with the .java extension.\n(2)starting entity: The starting entity is also called salient entity, and the salient entity is the root change that causes the modification of the rest of entities in a change set, while the rest of entities are the dependency modification along with the salient one.\nYou will be presented with a starting entity and tools (functions) will be provided to access the more information of the origin system. Your task is to gradually explain which entity really need to be synchronized, based on the starting entity and the information obtained through the function-call. You have 7 chances to call the function to get more information."

Moreover, the conceptual coupling between `ImageLibrary.java` and `GUI.java` is relatively high at 0.7677, indicating a strong semantic similarity.

Given its frequent co-change pattern, it's reasonable to infer that changes in `ImageLibrary.java` could impact `Canvas.java`.\n\n3. **TilePanel.java**: Similar to `Canvas.java`, this entity has been co-changed 5 times with `ImageLibrary.java`, resulting in a confidence level of 0.1471. The repeated co-occurrence suggests that these two files are closely related in terms of functionality or context, necessitating synchronized changes.\n\n4. **MapControls.java**: This entity appeared 4 times together with `ImageLibrary.java`, leading to a confidence level of 0.1176. Although its confidence is slightly lower compared to `Canvas.java` and `TilePanel.java`, the frequency of co-changes still indicates a potential need for synchronized modifications.\n\n5. **MiniMap.java**: Also appearing 4 times with `ImageLibrary.java`, `MiniMap.java` shares the same confidence level as `MapControls.java`. Its inclusion in the change set is based on the assumption that both entities might share dependencies or similar contexts that require concurrent updates.\n\nThe elements in the Change set are sorted in descending order of the likelihood of synchronized modifications based on their support counts and confidence levels from the co-change analysis.

Moreover, the conceptual coupling between `ImageLibrary.java` and `GUI.java` is relatively high at 0.7677, indicating a strong semantic similarity.

The repeated co-occurrence suggests that these two files are closely related in terms of functionality or context, necessitating synchronized changes.\n\n4. **MapControls.java**: This entity appeared 4 times together with `ImageLibrary.java`, leading to a confidence level of 0.1176.

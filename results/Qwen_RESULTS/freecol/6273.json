Call graph analysis showed no direct method calls from `EditSettlementDialog.java` to `CanvasMapEditorMouseListener.java`.\n3.

The conceptual coupling between `EditSettlementDialog.java` and `CanvasMapEditorMouseListener.java` shows a moderate level of semantic similarity.\n\nBased on this information, although there is a moderate conceptual relationship between `EditSettlementDialog.java` and `CanvasMapEditorMouseListener.java`, there is no strong evidence of code-level dependency or direct interaction. Therefore, while `CanvasMapEditorMouseListener.java` might be worth checking during a manual review due to its co-change history, it does not seem strictly necessary to automatically synchronize changes based solely on the available data.\n\nIf we have remaining function calls, we could explore other potential entities that may need synchronization with `EditSettlementDialog.java`. Otherwise, based on our findings, no additional entities beyond `CanvasMapEditorMouseListener.java` (which should be reviewed manually) appear to require automatic synchronization at this time.

CanvasMapEditorMouseListener.java: Although there are no direct method calls or coupling dependencies between `EditSettlementDialog.java` and `CanvasMapEditorMouseListener.java`, they have been co-changed together in the past with a confidence of 1.0. This implies that changes to `EditSettlementDialog.java` often required changes to `CanvasMapEditorMouseListener.java`. Additionally, the conceptual coupling with a semantic similarity probability of 0.67 suggests a moderate level of relatedness in functionality or purpose. Therefore, it is likely that modifications to `EditSettlementDialog.java` may necessitate corresponding changes in `CanvasMapEditorMouseListener.java`.\n\n2. SettlementTransform.java: The function `get_co_change_relationship` also indicated that `SettlementTransform.java` has been modified alongside `EditSettlementDialog.java` with a confidence of 1.0. However, this entity has since been removed from the project due to version iteration. Since it no longer exists in the current project context, it does not require synchronization anymore. It is included here for completeness based on historical co-change data.\n\nThe elements in the Change set are sorted in descending order of the likelihood of synchronized modifications. Given the removal of `SettlementTransform.java` from the project, `CanvasMapEditorMouseListener.java` stands as the primary candidate for potential synchronized modifications with `EditSettlementDialog.java`. \n\nIt is important to note that any further analysis should consider manual review for entities like `CanvasMapEditorMouseListener.java` due to its historical co-change relationship but lack of current code-level dependency.",

Call graph analysis showed no direct method calls from `EditSettlementDialog.java` to `CanvasMapEditorMouseListener.java`.\n3.

Therefore, while `CanvasMapEditorMouseListener.java` might be worth checking during a manual review due to its co-change history, it does not seem strictly necessary to automatically synchronize changes based solely on the available data.\n\nIf we have remaining function calls, we could explore other potential entities that may need synchronization with `EditSettlementDialog.java`.

This implies that changes to `EditSettlementDialog.java` often required changes to `CanvasMapEditorMouseListener.java`. Additionally, the conceptual coupling with a semantic similarity probability of 0.67 suggests a moderate level of relatedness in functionality or purpose. Therefore, it is likely that modifications to `EditSettlementDialog.java` may necessitate corresponding changes in `CanvasMapEditorMouseListener.java`.\n\n2. SettlementTransform.java: The function `get_co_change_relationship` also indicated that `SettlementTransform.java` has been modified alongside `EditSettlementDialog.java` with a confidence of 1.0. However, this entity has since been removed from the project due to version iteration. Since it no longer exists in the current project context, it does not require synchronization anymore.

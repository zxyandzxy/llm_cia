This could be due to broader system-level changes or common requirements affecting both files during certain updates.\n\n2. **TerrainGenerator.java** (Supports: 2, Confidence: 0.333)\n   - Strong coupling dependencies were identified between `MapGenerator.java` and `TerrainGenerator.java`. Changes in `MapGenerator.java` directly affect how `TerrainGenerator` is used and instantiated, making it crucial to update `TerrainGenerator.java` alongside `MapGenerator.java`.\n\n3. **FreeColServer.java** (Supports: 2, Confidence: 0.333)\n   - Moderate support for co-changes exists with `FreeColServer.java`. Since it also appears in the call graph, this indicates a possible indirect dependency or interaction within the game server logic which might necessitate synchronization when changes occur.\n\n4. **MapEditorController.java** (Supports: 2, Confidence: 0.333)\n   - Similar to other entities in this list, `MapEditorController.java` shows a moderate co-change relationship with `MapGenerator.java`. It's likely involved in map editing features that correlate with map generation tasks, requiring potential synchronization.\n\n5. **SimpleMapGenerator.java** (Supports: 2, Confidence: 0.333)\n   - This entity has a similar level of co-change support as others listed above. Being another generator class, it may share some functionalities or dependencies with `MapGenerator.java`, suggesting the need for synchronized changes.\n\n6. **NewEmptyMapAction.java** (Supports: 2, Confidence: 0.333)\n   - With the same level of co-change support, this entity seems to be related to actions involving new maps, potentially relying on the functionality provided by `MapGenerator.java`. Thus, changes might need to be synchronized to maintain consistency across map-related operations.\n\nIn conclusion, the entities listed in the change set should be considered for synchronized modifications whenever `MapGenerator.java` undergoes changes, with priority given to those with higher confidence in co-change relationships and stronger coupling dependencies.",

This could be due to broader system-level changes or common requirements affecting both files during certain updates.\n\n2. **TerrainGenerator.java** (Supports: 2, Confidence: 0.333)\n   - Strong coupling dependencies were identified between `MapGenerator.java` and `TerrainGenerator.java`. Changes in `MapGenerator.java` directly affect how `TerrainGenerator` is used and instantiated, making it crucial to update `TerrainGenerator.java` alongside `MapGenerator.java`.\n\n3. **FreeColServer.java** (Supports: 2, Confidence: 0.333)\n   - Moderate support for co-changes exists with `FreeColServer.java`. Since it also appears in the call graph, this indicates a possible indirect dependency or interaction within the game server logic which might necessitate synchronization when changes occur.\n\n4. **MapEditorController.java** (Supports: 2, Confidence: 0.333)\n   - Similar to other entities in this list, `MapEditorController.java` shows a moderate co-change relationship with `MapGenerator.java`. It's likely involved in map editing features that correlate with map generation tasks, requiring potential synchronization.\n\n5. **SimpleMapGenerator.java** (Supports: 2, Confidence: 0.333)\n   - This entity has a similar level of co-change support as others listed above. Being another generator class, it may share some functionalities or dependencies with `MapGenerator.java`, suggesting the need for synchronized changes.\n\n6. **NewEmptyMapAction.java** (Supports: 2, Confidence: 0.333)\n   - With the same level of co-change support, this entity seems to be related to actions involving new maps, potentially relying on the functionality provided by `MapGenerator.java`. Thus, changes might need to be synchronized to maintain consistency across map-related operations.\n\nIn conclusion, the entities listed in the change set should be considered for synchronized modifications whenever `MapGenerator.java` undergoes changes, with priority given to those with higher confidence in co-change relationships and stronger coupling dependencies.",

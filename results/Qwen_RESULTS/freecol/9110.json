Additionally, the high conceptual coupling suggests that these two entities share similar functionalities or responsibilities, making it highly likely that changes to one will require changes to the other.\n\n2. **FreeColServer.java**:\n   - Support: 3\n   - Confidence: 0.75\n   - Conceptual Coupling: 0.839 (High)\n   - Explanation: With a relatively high support count and confidence level, `FreeColServer.java` often co-changes with `Connection.java`. The strong semantic similarity further supports the need for synchronization, indicating that both files are closely related in terms of functionality and should be reviewed together during modifications.\n\n3. **PreGameInputHandler.java**:\n   - Support: 2\n   - Confidence: 0.5\n   - Explanation: This entity has a moderate confidence level, suggesting that there is a reasonable chance that changes to `Connection.java` may also impact `PreGameInputHandler.java`. Although there is no direct evidence of semantic coupling, the historical co-change relationship implies some form of dependency between these files.\n\n4. **UserConnectionHandler.java**:\n   - Support: 2\n   - Confidence: 0.5\n   - Explanation: Similar to `PreGameInputHandler.java`, this entity has a moderate confidence level, indicating that changes to `Connection.java` might also necessitate changes to `UserConnectionHandler.java`. The co-change relationship suggests that these files are somewhat interdependent.\n\n5. **MetaRegister.java**:\n   - Support: 2\n   - Confidence: 0.5\n   - Explanation: `MetaRegister.java` shares a moderate co-change relationship with `Connection.java`. While the confidence level is not as high as the top two entities, the co-change history still makes it a candidate for synchronized changes when modifying `Connection.java`.\n\n6. **InGameController.java**:\n   - Support: 2\n   - Confidence: 0.5\n   - Explanation: This file also exhibits a moderate co-change relationship with `Connection.java`. The likelihood of needing synchronized changes is supported by the historical data, although the exact nature of the dependency is less clear without additional analysis.\n\n7. **Client.java**:\n   - Support: 2\n   - Confidence: 0.5\n   - Explanation: Lastly, `Client.java` appears in the co-change results with a moderate confidence level. It is included in the change set due to its observed co-change pattern with `Connection.java`, implying that changes to the connection logic might affect client-side operations.\n\nThe elements in the Change set are sorted in descending order of the likelihood of synchronized modifications based on their support counts and confidence levels. Entities like `ConnectController.java` and `FreeColServer.java` have stronger evidence supporting their inclusion at the top of the list due to higher confidence and semantic similarities.

Additionally, the high conceptual coupling suggests that these two entities share similar functionalities or responsibilities, making it highly likely that changes to one will require changes to the other.\n\n2. **FreeColServer.java**:\n   - Support: 3\n   - Confidence: 0.75\n   - Conceptual Coupling: 0.839 (High)\n   - Explanation: With a relatively high support count and confidence level, `FreeColServer.java` often co-changes with `Connection.java`. The strong semantic similarity further supports the need for synchronization, indicating that both files are closely related in terms of functionality and should be reviewed together during modifications.\n\n3. **PreGameInputHandler.java**:\n   - Support: 2\n   - Confidence: 0.5\n   - Explanation: This entity has a moderate confidence level, suggesting that there is a reasonable chance that changes to `Connection.java` may also impact `PreGameInputHandler.java`. Although there is no direct evidence of semantic coupling, the historical co-change relationship implies some form of dependency between these files.\n\n4. **UserConnectionHandler.java**:\n   - Support: 2\n   - Confidence: 0.5\n   - Explanation: Similar to `PreGameInputHandler.java`, this entity has a moderate confidence level, indicating that changes to `Connection.java` might also necessitate changes to `UserConnectionHandler.java`. The co-change relationship suggests that these files are somewhat interdependent.\n\n5. **MetaRegister.java**:\n   - Support: 2\n   - Confidence: 0.5\n   - Explanation: `MetaRegister.java` shares a moderate co-change relationship with `Connection.java`. While the confidence level is not as high as the top two entities, the co-change history still makes it a candidate for synchronized changes when modifying `Connection.java`.\n\n6. **InGameController.java**:\n   - Support: 2\n   - Confidence: 0.5\n   - Explanation: This file also exhibits a moderate co-change relationship with `Connection.java`. The likelihood of needing synchronized changes is supported by the historical data, although the exact nature of the dependency is less clear without additional analysis.\n\n7. **Client.java**:\n   - Support: 2\n   - Confidence: 0.5\n   - Explanation: Lastly, `Client.java` appears in the co-change results with a moderate confidence level. It is included in the change set due to its observed co-change pattern with `Connection.java`, implying that changes to the connection logic might affect client-side operations.\n\nThe elements in the Change set are sorted in descending order of the likelihood of synchronized modifications based on their support counts and confidence levels. Entities like `ConnectController.java` and `FreeColServer.java` have stronger evidence supporting their inclusion at the top of the list due to higher confidence and semantic similarities.

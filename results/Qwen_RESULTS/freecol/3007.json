Additionally, reviewing `Player.java` for necessary changes is also important because of its strong conceptual relationship.

Moreover, our conceptual coupling analysis reveals a stronger semantic similarity (`0.755`) between these two entities than with others.

Additionally, reviewing `Player.java` for necessary changes is also important because of its strong conceptual relationship.

In order to help solve the CIA mission, you should first understand some necessary concepts\uff1a\n(1)entity: Entities represent source code files in CIA tasks, and all the CIA tasks under study are based on the Java language, so entities are files with the .java extension.\n(2)starting entity: The starting entity is also called salient entity, and the salient entity is the root change that causes the modification of the rest of entities in a change set, while the rest of entities are the dependency modification along with the salient one.\nYou will be presented with a starting entity and tools (functions) will be provided to access the more information of the origin system. Your task is to gradually explain which entity really need to be synchronized, based on the starting entity and the information obtained through the function-call. You have 7 chances to call the function to get more information."

This co-change relationship might be due to shared functionality or design considerations related to the graphical user interface.\n  \n- **MiniMap.java**: Similar to `GUI.java`, `MiniMap.java` does not have any direct coupling dependencies with `ImageLibrary.java`. However, it has a support count of 4 and a confidence level of 0.1176, indicating that it is often changed alongside `ImageLibrary.java`. The co-change relationship could be due to their roles in displaying map-related information.\n\n- **Canvas.java**: With a support count of 5 and a confidence level of 0.147, `Canvas.java` is another entity that tends to be modified along with `ImageLibrary.java`. While there are no direct coupling dependencies, it's likely that both entities work closely together in rendering visual elements of the game.\n\n- **TilePanel.java**: Also having a support count of 5 and a confidence level of 0.147, `TilePanel.java` is involved in the display of tiles within the game. Even though there are no direct coupling dependencies with `ImageLibrary.java`, its frequent co-changes suggest a close association with the image handling logic.\n\n- **ResourceManager.java**: Unlike the other entities mentioned, `ResourceManager.java` has multiple static method invocations from `ImageLibrary.java`. These calls are used for retrieving images for various game objects such as nations, goods types, unit types, settlements, etc. Given the strong coupling dependency through these method calls, any changes to how images are handled in `ImageLibrary.java` would likely require corresponding changes in `ResourceManager.java`.\n\nThe elements in the Change set are sorted in descending order of the likelihood of synchronized modifications based on the number of supports and confidence levels obtained from the co-change analysis. The top entity, `GUI.java`, is most likely to need synchronization due to its high frequency of co-changes with `ImageLibrary.java`.

This co-change relationship might be due to shared functionality or design considerations related to the graphical user interface.\n  \n- **MiniMap.java**: Similar to `GUI.java`, `MiniMap.java` does not have any direct coupling dependencies with `ImageLibrary.java`. However, it has a support count of 4 and a confidence level of 0.1176, indicating that it is often changed alongside `ImageLibrary.java`. The co-change relationship could be due to their roles in displaying map-related information.\n\n- **Canvas.java**: With a support count of 5 and a confidence level of 0.147, `Canvas.java` is another entity that tends to be modified along with `ImageLibrary.java`. While there are no direct coupling dependencies, it's likely that both entities work closely together in rendering visual elements of the game.\n\n- **TilePanel.java**: Also having a support count of 5 and a confidence level of 0.147, `TilePanel.java` is involved in the display of tiles within the game. Even though there are no direct coupling dependencies with `ImageLibrary.java`, its frequent co-changes suggest a close association with the image handling logic.\n\n- **ResourceManager.java**: Unlike the other entities mentioned, `ResourceManager.java` has multiple static method invocations from `ImageLibrary.java`. These calls are used for retrieving images for various game objects such as nations, goods types, unit types, settlements, etc. Given the strong coupling dependency through these method calls, any changes to how images are handled in `ImageLibrary.java` would likely require corresponding changes in `ResourceManager.java`.\n\nThe elements in the Change set are sorted in descending order of the likelihood of synchronized modifications based on the number of supports and confidence levels obtained from the co-change analysis. The top entity, `GUI.java`, is most likely to need synchronization due to its high frequency of co-changes with `ImageLibrary.java`. Following that, `ResourceManager.java` is included because of its direct code-level dependency, even though its co-change frequency is lower than the others.",

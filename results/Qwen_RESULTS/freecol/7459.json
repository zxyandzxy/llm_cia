Synchronization might be necessary depending on the nature of changes.\n\n- **Game.java**: Appeared once in past changes with `OptionGroup.java`. As the core game class, it might interact with various option groups for settings or game rules, requiring updates when option handling changes.\n\n- **ConnectController.java**: Similar to `Game.java`, it appeared once and might depend on `OptionGroup` for connection settings or parameters.\n\n- **AudioMixerOption.java, ClientOptions.java, FreeColClient.java, ActionManager.java**: Each of these entities also appeared once in past changes with `OptionGroup.java`.

Additionally, it extends `OptionGroup` through inheritance (IH), indicating a strong relationship. Changes to `OptionGroup.java` will very likely require changes to `OptionMap.java`.\n\n- **AbstractOption.java**: With a moderate number of supports (3) and confidence (0.33), this entity appears frequently alongside `OptionGroup.java` in past changes. Although no direct coupling dependencies were found between them, they might be part of a broader system of options that are often updated together.\n\n- **SelectOptionUI.java**: Also with a moderate number of supports (3) and confidence (0.33), this entity is likely related to the UI components associated with option handling. It may need to be synchronized if changes affect how options are displayed or interacted with by users.\n\n- **OptionReader.java**: Appears twice in past changes with `OptionGroup.java`, suggesting a potential dependency on reading option configurations that could necessitate concurrent modifications.\n\n- **BooleanOption.java, IntegerOption.java, StringOption.java, PercentageOption.java, RangeOption.java, FileOption.java, UnitListOption.java, LanguageOption.java**: These entities all have one support and low confidence (0.11). They represent different types of options which might be using `OptionGroup` for their configuration or display logic. Synchronization might be necessary depending on the nature of changes.\n\n- **Game.java**: Appeared once in past changes with `OptionGroup.java`. As the core game class, it might interact with various option groups for settings or game rules, requiring updates when option handling changes.\n\n- **ConnectController.java**: Similar to `Game.java`, it appeared once and might depend on `OptionGroup` for connection settings or parameters.\n\n- **AudioMixerOption.java, ClientOptions.java, FreeColClient.java, ActionManager.java**: Each of these entities also appeared once in past changes with `OptionGroup.java`. They might rely on option management provided by `OptionGroup` for audio settings, client-specific options, overall client functionality, and action management respectively.\n\nThe elements in the Change set are sorted in descending order of the likelihood of synchronized modifications based on historical co-change patterns and the presence of direct coupling dependencies such as inheritance.

In order to help solve the CIA mission, you should first understand some necessary concepts\uff1a\n(1)entity: Entities represent source code files in CIA tasks, and all the CIA tasks under study are based on the Java language, so entities are files with the .java extension.\n(2)starting entity: The starting entity is also called salient entity, and the salient entity is the root change that causes the modification of the rest of entities in a change set, while the rest of entities are the dependency modification along with the salient one.\nYou will be presented with a starting entity and tools (functions) will be provided to access the more information of the origin system. Your task is to gradually explain which entity really need to be synchronized, based on the starting entity and the information obtained through the function-call.

It's likely that changes in how images and graphical assets are handled (ImageLibrary.java) will have implications for the graphical user interface (GUI.java), even if these connections are not explicit in the code structure.\n\nIn conclusion, based on our analysis with the provided functions, **GUI.java** should indeed be considered for synchronization when modifying **ImageLibrary.java**, primarily due to their historical co-change patterns and strong conceptual coupling. Other entities like MiniMap.java, MapControls.java, Canvas.java, and TilePanel.java may also need attention, but given the limited number of checks we can perform, focusing on GUI.java seems to be the most strategic approach.\n\nIf there were more chances to call the functions, we could further investigate additional entities that have shown co-change relationships with ImageLibrary.java to ensure comprehensive change impact analysis.

They manage different user actions that involve zooming operations which typically depend on proper image handling and display.\n\n7. **ResourceManager.java**: This class has 2 supports and a confidence of 0.06.

The conceptual coupling between ImageLibrary.java and GUI.java further reinforces the need to consider GUI.java as a primary candidate for synchronized changes.

Other entities like MiniMap.java, MapControls.java, Canvas.java, and TilePanel.java may also need attention, but given the limited number of checks we can perform, focusing on GUI.java seems to be the most strategic approach.\n\nIf there were more chances to call the functions, we could further investigate additional entities that have shown co-change relationships with ImageLibrary.java to ensure comprehensive change impact analysis.

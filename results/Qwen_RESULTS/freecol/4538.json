This result highlights the importance of considering both code-level and conceptual relationships when performing change impact analysis. \n\nSince we've used up most of our function calls, and we have enough evidence to suggest which file needs to be updated alongside `GoodsTradeItem.java`, we can finalize our CIA task here.

This result highlights the importance of considering both code-level and conceptual relationships when performing change impact analysis. \n\nSince we've used up most of our function calls, and we have enough evidence to suggest which file needs to be updated alongside `GoodsTradeItem.java`, we can finalize our CIA task here.

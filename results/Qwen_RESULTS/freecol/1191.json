Additionally, the conceptual coupling between these two files is significant (80.74%), indicating they share a similar purpose or functionality within the project. Therefore, changes to `LostCityRumour.java` likely necessitate corresponding changes in `InGameInputHandler.java`.\n\n2. **InGameController.java**: Similarly, this file also shares a co-change relationship with `LostCityRumour.java`, having been modified concurrently once and with a confidence level of 0.5. It also exhibits strong conceptual similarity (80.29%). This suggests that both entities are closely related in terms of their roles and responsibilities within the software system, making it important to synchronize any changes.\n\n3. **MapGenerator.java**: Although not directly interacting through method calls or variable references, `MapGenerator.java` has shown a co-change relationship with `LostCityRumour.java`. The conceptual coupling score (80.22%) further supports the notion that these files may be conceptually linked. Thus, it is advisable to include `MapGenerator.java` in the synchronization process when modifying `LostCityRumour.java`.\n\nIn conclusion, based on historical co-change patterns and semantic similarities, it is recommended to synchronize changes across all three files - `InGameInputHandler.java`, `InGameController.java`, and `MapGenerator.java` - when making modifications to `LostCityRumour.java`.",

Additionally, the conceptual coupling between these two files is significant (80.74%), indicating they share a similar purpose or functionality within the project. Therefore, changes to `LostCityRumour.java` likely necessitate corresponding changes in `InGameInputHandler.java`.\n\n2. **InGameController.java**: Similarly, this file also shares a co-change relationship with `LostCityRumour.java`, having been modified concurrently once and with a confidence level of 0.5. It also exhibits strong conceptual similarity (80.29%). This suggests that both entities are closely related in terms of their roles and responsibilities within the software system, making it important to synchronize any changes.\n\n3. **MapGenerator.java**: Although not directly interacting through method calls or variable references, `MapGenerator.java` has shown a co-change relationship with `LostCityRumour.java`. The conceptual coupling score (80.22%) further supports the notion that these files may be conceptually linked. Thus, it is advisable to include `MapGenerator.java` in the synchronization process when modifying `LostCityRumour.java`.\n\nIn conclusion, based on historical co-change patterns and semantic similarities, it is recommended to synchronize changes across all three files - `InGameInputHandler.java`, `InGameController.java`, and `MapGenerator.java` - when making modifications to `LostCityRumour.java`.",

It could be due to shared functionality, coordination of behaviors across different parts of the application, or perhaps some architectural patterns that require them to be updated simultaneously.\n\nSince there's no direct coupling, let's investigate another entity from the co-change list that also showed high support and confidence, which is `InGameController`.

The lack of direct coupling dependencies implies that this relationship is driven by functional interdependence rather than explicit code-level connections.\n\n3. **FreeCol**: Directly uses `Message.java` according to call graph analysis.\n   - Since `FreeCol` directly references `Message.java`, any change in `Message.java` will have a direct impact on `FreeCol`, making it crucial to synchronize these changes.\n\n4. **StealLandMessage**: Support: 1, Confidence: 0.25, Conceptual Coupling: 0.818\n   - Despite having only one instance of co-change, the high semantic similarity probability indicates a significant conceptual relationship.

Additionally, the `get_coupling_dependencies` function showed a Function Parameter Invoking Method (FPIM) coupling dependency between `EquipmentType.java` and `Specification.java`, with `Specification` being used in the method `readChildren` at line 215. Moreover, the `get_conceptual_coupling` function indicated a high semantic similarity probability of 0.842. Due to the direct call, strong coupling, and high semantic similarity, changes in `EquipmentType.java` are very likely to necessitate corresponding changes in `Specification.java`.\n\n2. **UnitTest**: The `get_co_change_relationship` function returned that `UnitTest.java` has been co-changed with `EquipmentType.java` every time, with a support count of 1 and confidence of 1.0. This indicates a strong correlation where any modification to `EquipmentType.java` also requires updating or testing `UnitTest.java` to ensure that the unit tests remain valid.\n\n3. **SpecificationTest**: Similar to `UnitTest.java`, the `get_co_change_relationship` function also returned that `SpecificationTest.java` has been co-changed with `EquipmentType.java` every time, with a support count of 1 and confidence of 1.0. Therefore, changes to `EquipmentType.java` should be accompanied by updates or testing of `SpecificationTest.java` to maintain test consistency.\n\nThe elements in the Change set are sorted in descending order of the likelihood of synchronized modifications based on the strength of the dependencies and the context provided by the analysis functions. `Specification` is listed first due to its direct interaction and high semantic similarity with `EquipmentType.java`, while both `UnitTest` and `SpecificationTest` follow, as they have shown a perfect co-change relationship but do not exhibit direct functional or semantic coupling.",

This high similarity score indicates that these two entities are semantically related, further supporting the need to synchronize changes between them.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the co-change analysis, call graph, coupling dependencies, and conceptual coupling, we have identified three Java files that should be synchronized with changes in `EquipmentType.java`:\n\n1. `UnitTest.java` - Co-changed every time with `EquipmentType.java`.\n2. `SpecificationTest.java` - Co-changed every time with `EquipmentType.java`.\n3. `Specification.java` - Directly called by `EquipmentType.java` and has a strong coupling as well as high semantic similarity.\n\nThese findings suggest that when making changes to `EquipmentType.java`, you should also consider updating or testing `UnitTest.java`, `SpecificationTest.java`, and `Specification.java` to ensure consistency across the software system.",

Additionally, the `get_coupling_dependencies` function showed a Function Parameter Invoking Method (FPIM) coupling dependency between `EquipmentType.java` and `Specification.java`, with `Specification` being used in the method `readChildren` at line 215. Moreover, the `get_conceptual_coupling` function indicated a high semantic similarity probability of 0.842. Due to the direct call, strong coupling, and high semantic similarity, changes in `EquipmentType.java` are very likely to necessitate corresponding changes in `Specification.java`.\n\n2. **UnitTest**: The `get_co_change_relationship` function returned that `UnitTest.java` has been co-changed with `EquipmentType.java` every time, with a support count of 1 and confidence of 1.0. This indicates a strong correlation where any modification to `EquipmentType.java` also requires updating or testing `UnitTest.java` to ensure that the unit tests remain valid.\n\n3. **SpecificationTest**: Similar to `UnitTest.java`, the `get_co_change_relationship` function also returned that `SpecificationTest.java` has been co-changed with `EquipmentType.java` every time, with a support count of 1 and confidence of 1.0. Therefore, changes to `EquipmentType.java` should be accompanied by updates or testing of `SpecificationTest.java` to maintain test consistency.\n\nThe elements in the Change set are sorted in descending order of the likelihood of synchronized modifications based on the strength of the dependencies and the context provided by the analysis functions. `Specification` is listed first due to its direct interaction and high semantic similarity with `EquipmentType.java`, while both `UnitTest` and `SpecificationTest` follow, as they have shown a perfect co-change relationship but do not exhibit direct functional or semantic coupling.",

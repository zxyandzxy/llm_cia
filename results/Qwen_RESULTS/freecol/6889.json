In order to help solve the CIA mission, you should first understand some necessary concepts\uff1a\n(1)entity: Entities represent source code files in CIA tasks, and all the CIA tasks under study are based on the Java language, so entities are files with the .java extension.\n(2)starting entity: The starting entity is also called salient entity, and the salient entity is the root change that causes the modification of the rest of entities in a change set, while the rest of entities are the dependency modification along with the salient one.\nYou will be presented with a starting entity and tools (functions) will be provided to access the more information of the origin system. Your task is to gradually explain which entity really need to be synchronized, based on the starting entity and the information obtained through the function-call. You have 7 chances to call the function to get more information."

Changes to `OptionGroup.java` are likely to affect `OptionMap.java` due to their inheritance relationship.\n- **AbstractOption.java**: Although there are no direct coupling dependencies between `OptionGroup.java` and `AbstractOption.java`, they have a high conceptual similarity (semantic similarity probability of approximately 0.88). They might be involved in similar functionalities or features within the project, necessitating synchronized changes.\n- **SelectOptionUI.java**: Similar to `AbstractOption.java`, this entity shares a high conceptual similarity with `OptionGroup.java` (semantic similarity probability of approximately 0.87), indicating that they could be conceptually related and thus often changed together.\n- **OptionGroupUI.java, AudioMixerOption.java, ClientOptions.java, OptionReader.java, FreeColClient.java, SoundTest.java, BooleanOption.java, IntegerOption.java, ServerUnitTest.java, FoundingFatherTest.java, IntegerOptionUI.java, ConnectController.java, SelectableAction.java, DisplayTileTextAction.java, DisplayBordersAction.java, DisplayGridAction.java, MapControlsAction.java, ChangeWindowedModeAction.java, Game.java, StringOption.java, OptionsDialog.java, AbstractUnitOption.java, FileOption.java, UnitListOption.java, LanguageOption.java, SelectOption.java, RangeOption.java, PercentageOption.java**: These entities have lower support counts and confidence values compared to the top three. However, given their co-change relationships with `OptionGroup.java`, it is prudent to consider them for potential synchronized changes, especially if they share common contexts or functionalities.\n\nThe elements in the change set are sorted in descending order of the likelihood of synchronized modifications based on the provided data and analysis. Entities like `OptionMap.java` are prioritized due to strong code coupling, while others are included due to moderate co-change frequencies and conceptual similarities.",

Since equipment can be associated with units, changes to `UnitType` might affect how equipment is used or defined.\n\n7. **Unit.java**: Modified 4 times with a confidence of 0.1905, indicating that the actual instances of units are directly affected by changes in their type definitions.\n\n8. **IndianNationType.java**: With 3 supports and a confidence of 0.1429, this entity might need updates if changes in `UnitType` impact how native populations interact with units.\n\n9. **FoundingFather.java**: Appearing 3 times with a confidence of 0.1429, it implies that special abilities or bonuses from founding fathers may be linked to unit capabilities.\n\n10. **Colony.java**: With 4 supports and a confidence of 0.1905, colonies could be influenced by changes in unit types since units play crucial roles in managing and defending them.\n\nThese entities should be reviewed for necessary modifications whenever changes are made to `UnitType.java` to maintain consistency and avoid potential issues within the game logic.

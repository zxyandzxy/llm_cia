This indicates that historically, changes to `MapControls.java` were often accompanied by changes to `MapControlsAction`. However, since it is no longer part of the project, we will not consider it for synchronization.\n\n2. **UnitButton**: Despite the lack of direct coupling dependencies between `MapControls.java` and `UnitButton.java`, they exhibit a strong conceptual coupling (0.796). This suggests that both entities are semantically related and share common functionality or context within the software system. Therefore, when making changes to `MapControls.java`, it's important to also review `UnitButton.java` to ensure consistency and correctness across these interrelated components.\n\n3. **UserInputHandler**: This entity appears in both the co-change list and the call graph, indicating that it interacts directly with `MapControls.java`. With a confidence level of 0.33, changes to `MapControls.java` may require corresponding modifications in `UserInputHandler` to maintain compatibility and expected behavior.\n\n4. **InfoPanel**: Co-changed with `MapControls.java` once, with a confidence level of 0.33. While there isn't additional evidence linking it directly through calls or couplings, its presence in the co-change history implies a potential need for synchronization during modifications to `MapControls.java`.\n\n5. **Canvas**: Similar to `InfoPanel`, `Canvas` shares a co-change history with `MapControls.java` and has a confidence level of 0.33. The exact nature of their relationship isn't clear from our analysis, but past co-changes suggest that it might be impacted by changes to `MapControls.java`.\n\n6. **CornerMapControls**: This entity also has a co-change relationship with `MapControls.java`, appearing once in the change history with a confidence level of 0.33. Without further evidence of interaction or coupling, it is included in the change set based on historical data, although it ranks lower due to weaker signals.\n\nIn summary, `UnitButton` and `UserInputHandler` are the primary candidates for synchronized modifications with `MapControls.java`, given their direct interactions and/or strong conceptual relationships. Other entities (`InfoPanel`, `Canvas`, `CornerMapControls`) are listed as secondary considerations based on their co-change histories.",

This indicates that historically, changes to `MapControls.java` were often accompanied by changes to `MapControlsAction`. However, since it is no longer part of the project, we will not consider it for synchronization.\n\n2. **UnitButton**: Despite the lack of direct coupling dependencies between `MapControls.java` and `UnitButton.java`, they exhibit a strong conceptual coupling (0.796). This suggests that both entities are semantically related and share common functionality or context within the software system. Therefore, when making changes to `MapControls.java`, it's important to also review `UnitButton.java` to ensure consistency and correctness across these interrelated components.\n\n3. **UserInputHandler**: This entity appears in both the co-change list and the call graph, indicating that it interacts directly with `MapControls.java`. With a confidence level of 0.33, changes to `MapControls.java` may require corresponding modifications in `UserInputHandler` to maintain compatibility and expected behavior.\n\n4. **InfoPanel**: Co-changed with `MapControls.java` once, with a confidence level of 0.33. While there isn't additional evidence linking it directly through calls or couplings, its presence in the co-change history implies a potential need for synchronization during modifications to `MapControls.java`.\n\n5. **Canvas**: Similar to `InfoPanel`, `Canvas` shares a co-change history with `MapControls.java` and has a confidence level of 0.33. The exact nature of their relationship isn't clear from our analysis, but past co-changes suggest that it might be impacted by changes to `MapControls.java`.\n\n6. **CornerMapControls**: This entity also has a co-change relationship with `MapControls.java`, appearing once in the change history with a confidence level of 0.33. Without further evidence of interaction or coupling, it is included in the change set based on historical data, although it ranks lower due to weaker signals.\n\nIn summary, `UnitButton` and `UserInputHandler` are the primary candidates for synchronized modifications with `MapControls.java`, given their direct interactions and/or strong conceptual relationships. Other entities (`InfoPanel`, `Canvas`, `CornerMapControls`) are listed as secondary considerations based on their co-change histories.",

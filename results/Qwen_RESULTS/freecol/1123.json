Furthermore, it has a high conceptual coupling (0.848) indicating that both entities share similar functionality or purpose. Therefore, PioneeringMission is the most likely candidate for synchronization when changes are made to `TileImprovement.java`.\n\n2. **TileImprovementType**: Although this entity was initially identified as having a significant co-change relationship with `TileImprovement.java`, subsequent analysis revealed that it has been removed from the project due to version iteration. As such, it should no longer be considered as a candidate for synchronization.\n\n3. **InGameInputHandler, ScaleMapAction, TileItemContainer, Section, River, MapEditorTransformPanel, AIColony, WorkLocationPlan, TileTest, ColonyPlanTest**: These entities have all appeared once in the co-change history with `TileImprovement.java`. However, since they were not found to have any direct interactions through the call graph or significant coupling dependencies, their likelihood for requiring synchronized changes is lower compared to `PioneeringMission`. They are listed here based on the co-change support count but without additional evidence of dependency, the need for synchronization is less certain.\n\nNote: The actual relevance of these entities might vary depending on more detailed code analysis and understanding of the project's domain. The above explanation is based on the provided function calls and available information. For practical purposes, `PioneeringMission` stands out as the primary entity that needs to be synchronized with `TileImprovement.java`.

Furthermore, it has a high conceptual coupling (0.848) indicating that both entities share similar functionality or purpose. Therefore, PioneeringMission is the most likely candidate for synchronization when changes are made to `TileImprovement.java`.\n\n2. **TileImprovementType**: Although this entity was initially identified as having a significant co-change relationship with `TileImprovement.java`, subsequent analysis revealed that it has been removed from the project due to version iteration. As such, it should no longer be considered as a candidate for synchronization.\n\n3. **InGameInputHandler, ScaleMapAction, TileItemContainer, Section, River, MapEditorTransformPanel, AIColony, WorkLocationPlan, TileTest, ColonyPlanTest**: These entities have all appeared once in the co-change history with `TileImprovement.java`. However, since they were not found to have any direct interactions through the call graph or significant coupling dependencies, their likelihood for requiring synchronized changes is lower compared to `PioneeringMission`. They are listed here based on the co-change support count but without additional evidence of dependency, the need for synchronization is less certain.\n\nNote: The actual relevance of these entities might vary depending on more detailed code analysis and understanding of the project's domain. The above explanation is based on the provided function calls and available information. For practical purposes, `PioneeringMission` stands out as the primary entity that needs to be synchronized with `TileImprovement.java`.

In order to help solve the CIA mission, you should first understand some necessary concepts\uff1a\n(1)entity: Entities represent source code files in CIA tasks, and all the CIA tasks under study are based on the Java language, so entities are files with the .java extension.\n(2)starting entity: The starting entity is also called salient entity, and the salient entity is the root change that causes the modification of the rest of entities in a change set, while the rest of entities are the dependency modification along with the salient one.\nYou will be presented with a starting entity and tools (functions) will be provided to access the more information of the origin system. Your task is to gradually explain which entity really need to be synchronized, based on the starting entity and the information obtained through the function-call. You have 7 chances to call the function to get more information."

They also share a co-change history with a support of 1 and confidence of 1.0. This implies that while they may not be directly dependent, they are semantically related and possibly part of the same feature or system requirement, necessitating synchronized changes.\n\n3. **Selector.java**: Like `Messages.java`, there are no direct coupling dependencies or method calls between `Number.java` and `Selector.java`. However, they have been co-changed with a support of 1 and confidence of 1.0. While we do not have a conceptual coupling score for this entity, its co-change pattern with `Number.java` suggests that it might be indirectly related through the same feature set or module.

They also share a co-change history with a support of 1 and confidence of 1.0. This implies that while they may not be directly dependent, they are semantically related and possibly part of the same feature or system requirement, necessitating synchronized changes.\n\n3. **Selector.java**: Like `Messages.java`, there are no direct coupling dependencies or method calls between `Number.java` and `Selector.java`. However, they have been co-changed with a support of 1 and confidence of 1.0. While we do not have a conceptual coupling score for this entity, its co-change pattern with `Number.java` suggests that it might be indirectly related through the same feature set or module.

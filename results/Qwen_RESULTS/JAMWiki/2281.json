Changes to authentication-related constants may also require updates to exception handling logic within this filter.\n\n3. **JAMWikiServlet**: This entity appears once in the co-change history with `JAMWikiAuthenticationConstants.java` (confidence 0.5). While the conceptual relationship was not measured, its appearance suggests some form of dependency, though less evident than with `LoginServlet` or `JAMWikiExceptionTranslationFilter`.\n\n4. **JAMWikiAuthenticationProcessingFilter**: Similar to `JAMWikiServlet`, it has been changed alongside `JAMWikiAuthenticationConstants.java` once (confidence 0.5). Given the nature of both entities being related to authentication, it's reasonable to assume that changes could propagate here as well, but with less certainty compared to the top two entities.\n\n5. **AuthMsgTag**: It shares the lowest co-change frequency and confidence level (1 time, confidence 0.5) among all entities listed. There is no additional evidence from conceptual coupling analysis, suggesting that while it has appeared in co-changes, it is less likely to need synchronization compared to the other entities. \n\nIn conclusion, based on the co-change relationship and conceptual coupling, the priority for synchronization should be given to `LoginServlet`, followed by `JAMWikiExceptionTranslationFilter`, `JAMWikiServlet`, `JAMWikiAuthenticationProcessingFilter`, and lastly `AuthMsgTag`.",

While the conceptual relationship was not measured, its appearance suggests some form of dependency, though less evident than with `LoginServlet` or `JAMWikiExceptionTranslationFilter`.\n\n4. **JAMWikiAuthenticationProcessingFilter**: Similar to `JAMWikiServlet`, it has been changed alongside `JAMWikiAuthenticationConstants.java` once (confidence 0.5). Given the nature of both entities being related to authentication, it's reasonable to assume that changes could propagate here as well, but with less certainty compared to the top two entities.\n\n5. **AuthMsgTag**: It shares the lowest co-change frequency and confidence level (1 time, confidence 0.5) among all entities listed. There is no additional evidence from conceptual coupling analysis, suggesting that while it has appeared in co-changes, it is less likely to need synchronization compared to the other entities. \n\nIn conclusion, based on the co-change relationship and conceptual coupling, the priority for synchronization should be given to `LoginServlet`, followed by `JAMWikiExceptionTranslationFilter`, `JAMWikiServlet`, `JAMWikiAuthenticationProcessingFilter`, and lastly `AuthMsgTag`.",

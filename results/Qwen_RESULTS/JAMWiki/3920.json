This suggests that changes in `WikiConfiguration.java` often require corresponding adjustments in `AdminServlet.java` to maintain system consistency.\n\n2. **WikiConfigurationObject.java**: There is a strong coupling relationship with `WikiConfiguration.java`. The method `parseConfigurationObject` returns an instance of `WikiConfigurationObject`, creates and uses its instances directly, and calls multiple member methods on these instances. Therefore, any modifications to `WikiConfiguration.java` will likely necessitate changes in `WikiConfigurationObject.java`.\n\n3. **NamespaceHandler**: Co-changed 2 times with `WikiConfiguration.java`, having a confidence level of approximately 0.29. While we don't have detailed information about their coupling, the co-change history indicates a potential indirect dependency or related functionality requiring synchronization.\n\n4. **RegisterServlet**: Also co-changed 2 times with `WikiConfiguration.java` and shares a similar confidence level as `NamespaceHandler`. It may be indirectly affected by changes due to shared functionalities or dependencies not explicitly defined in the code structure.\n\n5. **JFlexCustomTagItem**: Co-changed 2 times with `WikiConfiguration.java` with a confidence level of approximately 0.29. It might be part of a broader set of components that are typically modified together when configuration settings are altered.\n\n6. **GalleryTag**: Co-changed 2 times with `WikiConfiguration.java`, also with a confidence level of approximately 0.29. Like `JFlexCustomTagItem`, this entity could be involved in areas of the application that rely on wiki configurations.\n\n7. **AbstractJAMWikiCustomTagLexer**: Co-changed 2 times with `WikiConfiguration.java` and has the same confidence level as `GalleryTag` and `JFlexCustomTagItem`. Its inclusion in the co-change list implies that it's part of the interrelated components that are frequently updated alongside `WikiConfiguration.java`.\n\n8. **PseudoTopicHandler**: Co-changed once with `WikiConfiguration.java` and has the lowest confidence level among the listed entities (approximately 0.14). Despite the lower confidence, its presence in the co-change list suggests a potential need for synchronization, possibly due to indirect dependencies.\n\n9. **Environment**: Co-changed once with `WikiConfiguration.java`, sharing the same confidence level as `PseudoTopicHandler`. Changes in the environment setup might correlate with changes in the wiki configuration, warranting a review during updates.\n\n10. **EditServlet**: Co-changed once with `WikiConfiguration.java`, with the same confidence level as `PseudoTopicHandler` and `Environment`. Given its role in handling edits, it may need adjustments when configuration settings affecting user interactions are changed.\n\n11. **UpgradeServlet**: Co-changed once with `WikiConfiguration.java`, again with a confidence level of approximately 0.14. It could be involved in processes that depend on the current state of the wiki configuration, especially during upgrades.\n\nThe elements in the Change set are sorted in descending order of the likelihood of synchronized modifications based on the number of supports and confidence levels obtained from the co-change analysis. Entities with higher support counts and confidence levels are more likely to require synchronization with `WikiConfiguration.java`. However, it's important to note that `WikiConfigurationObject.java` stands out due to its direct coupling dependencies, making it the most critical entity to synchronize along with `WikiConfiguration.java`.",

This suggests that changes in `WikiConfiguration.java` often require corresponding adjustments in `AdminServlet.java` to maintain system consistency.\n\n2. **WikiConfigurationObject.java**: There is a strong coupling relationship with `WikiConfiguration.java`. The method `parseConfigurationObject` returns an instance of `WikiConfigurationObject`, creates and uses its instances directly, and calls multiple member methods on these instances. Therefore, any modifications to `WikiConfiguration.java` will likely necessitate changes in `WikiConfigurationObject.java`.\n\n3. **NamespaceHandler**: Co-changed 2 times with `WikiConfiguration.java`, having a confidence level of approximately 0.29. While we don't have detailed information about their coupling, the co-change history indicates a potential indirect dependency or related functionality requiring synchronization.\n\n4. **RegisterServlet**: Also co-changed 2 times with `WikiConfiguration.java` and shares a similar confidence level as `NamespaceHandler`. It may be indirectly affected by changes due to shared functionalities or dependencies not explicitly defined in the code structure.\n\n5. **JFlexCustomTagItem**: Co-changed 2 times with `WikiConfiguration.java` with a confidence level of approximately 0.29. It might be part of a broader set of components that are typically modified together when configuration settings are altered.\n\n6. **GalleryTag**: Co-changed 2 times with `WikiConfiguration.java`, also with a confidence level of approximately 0.29. Like `JFlexCustomTagItem`, this entity could be involved in areas of the application that rely on wiki configurations.\n\n7. **AbstractJAMWikiCustomTagLexer**: Co-changed 2 times with `WikiConfiguration.java` and has the same confidence level as `GalleryTag` and `JFlexCustomTagItem`. Its inclusion in the co-change list implies that it's part of the interrelated components that are frequently updated alongside `WikiConfiguration.java`.\n\n8. **PseudoTopicHandler**: Co-changed once with `WikiConfiguration.java` and has the lowest confidence level among the listed entities (approximately 0.14). Despite the lower confidence, its presence in the co-change list suggests a potential need for synchronization, possibly due to indirect dependencies.\n\n9. **Environment**: Co-changed once with `WikiConfiguration.java`, sharing the same confidence level as `PseudoTopicHandler`. Changes in the environment setup might correlate with changes in the wiki configuration, warranting a review during updates.\n\n10. **EditServlet**: Co-changed once with `WikiConfiguration.java`, with the same confidence level as `PseudoTopicHandler` and `Environment`. Given its role in handling edits, it may need adjustments when configuration settings affecting user interactions are changed.\n\n11. **UpgradeServlet**: Co-changed once with `WikiConfiguration.java`, again with a confidence level of approximately 0.14. It could be involved in processes that depend on the current state of the wiki configuration, especially during upgrades.\n\nThe elements in the Change set are sorted in descending order of the likelihood of synchronized modifications based on the number of supports and confidence levels obtained from the co-change analysis. Entities with higher support counts and confidence levels are more likely to require synchronization with `WikiConfiguration.java`. However, it's important to note that `WikiConfigurationObject.java` stands out due to its direct coupling dependencies, making it the most critical entity to synchronize along with `WikiConfiguration.java`.",

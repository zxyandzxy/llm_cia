In order to help solve the CIA mission, you should first understand some necessary concepts\uff1a\n(1)entity: Entities represent source code files in CIA tasks, and all the CIA tasks under study are based on the Java language, so entities are files with the .java extension.\n(2)starting entity: The starting entity is also called salient entity, and the salient entity is the root change that causes the modification of the rest of entities in a change set, while the rest of entities are the dependency modification along with the salient one.\nYou will be presented with a starting entity and tools (functions) will be provided to access the more information of the origin system. Your task is to gradually explain which entity really need to be synchronized, based on the starting entity and the information obtained through the function-call. You have 7 chances to call the function to get more information."

It is probable that both classes handle aspects of image metadata processing and should be changed in synchronization.\n\n3. **ImageUtilTest** - 5 supports, Confidence: 0.278, Conceptual Coupling: 0.858\n   - Despite the lack of direct coupling dependencies, `ImageUtilTest` has a high conceptual similarity with `ImageUtil.java`.

This indicates that both entities likely deal with related functionalities concerning image links and thus should be modified together.\n\n2. **ImageMetadata** - 8 supports, Confidence: 0.444, Conceptual Coupling: 0.850\n   - Similarly to `ImageLinkTag`, `ImageMetadata` shares a strong conceptual relationship with `ImageUtil.java`. It is probable that both classes handle aspects of image metadata processing and should be changed in synchronization.\n\n3. **ImageUtilTest** - 5 supports, Confidence: 0.278, Conceptual Coupling: 0.858\n   - Despite the lack of direct coupling dependencies, `ImageUtilTest` has a high conceptual similarity with `ImageUtil.java`.

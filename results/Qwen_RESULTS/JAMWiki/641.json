Changes in `SearchEngine.java` are highly likely to necessitate changes in `SearchServlet.java`.\n\n3. **WikiBase**:\n   - Support: 2\n   - Confidence: 0.286\n   While it does not have a direct method call or variable reference from `SearchEngine.java`, its moderate support and confidence suggest it may have some indirect coupling with `SearchEngine.java`.\n\n4. **AbstractSearchEngine**:\n   - Support: 2\n   - Confidence: 0.286\n   As an abstract class, it could be extended by `SearchEngine.java`.

When functionality changes, corresponding tests may need to be updated or rewritten.\n\n7. **RankingAlgorithmSearchEngine**:\n   - Support: 2\n   - Confidence: 0.286\n   Another search engine implementation which might share common interfaces or base classes with `SearchEngine.java`, indicating possible co-changes.\n\nPlease note that the removal of `LuceneSearchEngine` from the project reduces its relevance for current change synchronization, but it remains part of the historical context.

Changes in `SearchEngine.java` are highly likely to necessitate changes in `SearchServlet.java`.\n\n3. **WikiBase**:\n   - Support: 2\n   - Confidence: 0.286\n   While it does not have a direct method call or variable reference from `SearchEngine.java`, its moderate support and confidence suggest it may have some indirect coupling with `SearchEngine.java`.\n\n4. **AbstractSearchEngine**:\n   - Support: 2\n   - Confidence: 0.286\n   As an abstract class, it could be extended by `SearchEngine.java`. The co-change relationship suggests potential inheritance or interface implementation coupling, making it a candidate for synchronized changes.\n\n5. **LinkToServlet**:\n   - Support: 2\n   - Confidence: 0.286\n   With similar support and confidence values to `WikiBase` and `AbstractSearchEngine`, this servlet might interact with `SearchEngine.java` through other means such as shared data structures or utility functions.\n\n6. **TestSearchEngine**:\n   - Support: 2\n   - Confidence: 0.286\n   Likely contains test cases for `SearchEngine.java`. When functionality changes, corresponding tests may need to be updated or rewritten.\n\n7. **RankingAlgorithmSearchEngine**:\n   - Support: 2\n   - Confidence: 0.286\n   Another search engine implementation which might share common interfaces or base classes with `SearchEngine.java`, indicating possible co-changes.\n\nPlease note that the removal of `LuceneSearchEngine` from the project reduces its relevance for current change synchronization, but it remains part of the historical context.

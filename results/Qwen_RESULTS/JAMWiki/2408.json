This may be due to them being part of the same feature or module within the application.\n\n2. **WikiConfigurationObject**: Support: 2, Confidence: 0.286\n   - Direct code interdependencies exist between `WikiConfiguration.java` and `WikiConfigurationObject`. The method `parseConfigurationObject` in `WikiConfiguration.java` returns an instance of `WikiConfigurationObject`, creates instances of it, and uses its methods. Therefore, any changes in `WikiConfiguration.java` will likely require changes to `WikiConfigurationObject`.\n\n3. **NamespaceHandler**: Support: 2, Confidence: 0.286\n   - While there are no direct coupling dependencies between `WikiConfiguration.java` and `NamespaceHandler`, they have a co-change relationship. They might be indirectly related through common features or functionalities within the application.\n\n4. **JFlexCustomTagItem**: Support: 2, Confidence: 0.286\n   - There is no direct evidence of coupling dependencies between `WikiConfiguration.java` and `JFlexCustomTagItem`. However, the co-change relationship suggests that these two files might need to be modified together due to shared functionality or context within the project.\n\n5. **GalleryTag**: Support: 2, Confidence: 0.286\n   - Similar to `JFlexCustomTagItem`, there is no direct coupling dependency, but the co-change relationship indicates potential synchronization needs for changes.\n\n6. **AbstractJAMWikiCustomTagLexer**: Support: 2, Confidence: 0.286\n   - No direct coupling dependencies found, yet the co-change relationship implies that `AbstractJAMWikiCustomTagLexer` might require updates alongside `WikiConfiguration.java`.\n\n7. **RegisterServlet**: Support: 2, Confidence: 0.286\n   - Lastly, `RegisterServlet` also shares a co-change relationship with `WikiConfiguration.java`. Despite lacking direct coupling dependencies, it should still be considered for synchronized modifications due to the pattern observed in past changes.\n\nIn summary, while some entities like `WikiConfigurationObject` show clear reasons for synchronization through direct coupling dependencies, others such as `AdminServlet` and those with similar confidence levels indicate a need for synchronized changes based on historical co-modification patterns within the project.",

This may be due to them being part of the same feature or module within the application.\n\n2. **WikiConfigurationObject**: Support: 2, Confidence: 0.286\n   - Direct code interdependencies exist between `WikiConfiguration.java` and `WikiConfigurationObject`. The method `parseConfigurationObject` in `WikiConfiguration.java` returns an instance of `WikiConfigurationObject`, creates instances of it, and uses its methods. Therefore, any changes in `WikiConfiguration.java` will likely require changes to `WikiConfigurationObject`.\n\n3. **NamespaceHandler**: Support: 2, Confidence: 0.286\n   - While there are no direct coupling dependencies between `WikiConfiguration.java` and `NamespaceHandler`, they have a co-change relationship. They might be indirectly related through common features or functionalities within the application.\n\n4. **JFlexCustomTagItem**: Support: 2, Confidence: 0.286\n   - There is no direct evidence of coupling dependencies between `WikiConfiguration.java` and `JFlexCustomTagItem`. However, the co-change relationship suggests that these two files might need to be modified together due to shared functionality or context within the project.\n\n5. **GalleryTag**: Support: 2, Confidence: 0.286\n   - Similar to `JFlexCustomTagItem`, there is no direct coupling dependency, but the co-change relationship indicates potential synchronization needs for changes.\n\n6. **AbstractJAMWikiCustomTagLexer**: Support: 2, Confidence: 0.286\n   - No direct coupling dependencies found, yet the co-change relationship implies that `AbstractJAMWikiCustomTagLexer` might require updates alongside `WikiConfiguration.java`.\n\n7. **RegisterServlet**: Support: 2, Confidence: 0.286\n   - Lastly, `RegisterServlet` also shares a co-change relationship with `WikiConfiguration.java`. Despite lacking direct coupling dependencies, it should still be considered for synchronized modifications due to the pattern observed in past changes.\n\nIn summary, while some entities like `WikiConfigurationObject` show clear reasons for synchronization through direct coupling dependencies, others such as `AdminServlet` and those with similar confidence levels indicate a need for synchronized changes based on historical co-modification patterns within the project.",

Additionally, it has a high semantic similarity (conceptual coupling) of 0.869, suggesting that changes to `WikiDatabase.java` are likely to require corresponding changes in `UpgradeServlet`.\n\n2. **DatabaseUpgrades**: With a support count of 6 and confidence of 0.429, this entity is also highly correlated with `WikiDatabase.java` through co-changes. Although we did not check its conceptual coupling directly, the high confidence score makes it a strong candidate for synchronization.\n\n3. **AdminServlet**: It has a support count of 7 and a confidence of 0.5, which indicates a significant co-change relationship with `WikiDatabase.java`. It should be considered for synchronized changes due to its frequent appearance alongside `WikiDatabase.java` in version histories.\n\n4. **Role**: Having a support count of 3 and a confidence of 0.214, this entity shows moderate co-change correlation.

Additionally, it has a high semantic similarity (conceptual coupling) of 0.869, suggesting that changes to `WikiDatabase.java` are likely to require corresponding changes in `UpgradeServlet`.\n\n2. **DatabaseUpgrades**: With a support count of 6 and confidence of 0.429, this entity is also highly correlated with `WikiDatabase.java` through co-changes. Although we did not check its conceptual coupling directly, the high confidence score makes it a strong candidate for synchronization.\n\n3. **AdminServlet**: It has a support count of 7 and a confidence of 0.5, which indicates a significant co-change relationship with `WikiDatabase.java`. It should be considered for synchronized changes due to its frequent appearance alongside `WikiDatabase.java` in version histories.\n\n4. **Role**: Having a support count of 3 and a confidence of 0.214, this entity shows moderate co-change correlation. While it's lower than the previous three, it still suggests that `Role` may need updates when `WikiDatabase.java` is modified.\n\nEntities from the call graph dependencies follow, listed without specific ordering as they were not part of the co-change relationship analysis but have direct usage or references to `WikiDatabase.java`:\n\n5. **TopicVersion**\n6. **Environment**\n7. **WikiMessage**\n8. **DataHandler**\n9. **Topic**\n10. **WikiUtil**\n11. **WikiUser**\n12. **Encryption**\n13. **WikiLogger**\n14. **WikiGroup**\n\nThese entities are included because they directly use or reference `WikiDatabase.java`, which implies that any change in `WikiDatabase.java` could potentially affect their functionality.

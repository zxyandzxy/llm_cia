Despite having no direct coupling dependencies, their high conceptual similarity suggests they may be part of the same or closely related functionalities. Therefore, it's advisable to also consider reviewing these files when modifying `TopicVersion.java`.\n   \n3. **Other Entities**: Other entities like `PersistencyHandler.java` and `ManageServlet.java` have moderate co-change frequencies and should be considered on a case-by-case basis depending on the nature of the changes made to `TopicVersion.java`.\n\nIn conclusion, focusing on both the direct dependencies (`WikiBase`, `JMController`, `DBDate`) and frequently co-changed entities (`EditServlet.java`, `UploadServlet.java`, `MoveServlet.java`) will help ensure a thorough and effective synchronization during code changes within the JAMWiki project.",

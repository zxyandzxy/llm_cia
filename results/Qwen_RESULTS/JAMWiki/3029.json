Although there are no direct coupling dependencies between them, the high co-change frequency suggests that changes to `ImageUtil.java` often coincide with changes to `ImageLinkTag.java`, making it a priority for synchronized modifications.\n\n2. **ImageMetadata.java**: With a conceptual coupling score of 0.853, this entity shares a strong semantic relationship with `ImageUtil.java`. Additionally, it has a considerable support count (8) and confidence (0.444). The combination of these factors indicates that `ImageMetadata.java` is likely to require changes alongside `ImageUtil.java`.\n\n3. **LinkUtil.java**: It has a moderate support count (4) and confidence (0.222), suggesting some degree of co-change likelihood with `ImageUtil.java`. However, without additional evidence of coupling dependencies or conceptual similarity, its priority for synchronization is lower compared to the top two.\n\n4. **ParserFunctionUtil.java**: Similar to `LinkUtil.java`, it has a support count of 4 and confidence of 0.222. This indicates that it might be changed together with `ImageUtil.java`, but the need for synchronization is not as strong as for the first two entities.\n\n5. **JAMHTMLConverter.java**: This entity also shares a support count of 4 and confidence of 0.222 with `ImageUtil.java`. While it shows up in the co-change history, the lack of other evidence supporting a strong dependency makes its necessity for synchronized changes less critical.\n\n6. **ServletUtil.java**: With a support count of 2 and confidence of 0.111, `ServletUtil.java` appears less frequently in co-changes with `ImageUtil.java`. Nonetheless, given its presence in the co-change list, it should still be considered for potential impact analysis.\n\n7. **WikiPageInfo.java**: Lastly, `WikiPageInfo.java` has a support count of 3 and confidence of 0.167. Though it has slightly higher confidence than `ServletUtil.java`, the overall low frequency of co-changes means it is the least likely to require synchronized modifications among the entities listed.\n\nThe elements in the Change set are sorted in descending order of the likelihood of synchronized modifications based on the support count and confidence from the co-change relationship, along with any additional insights gained from examining coupling dependencies and conceptual similarities.",

Although there are no direct coupling dependencies between them, the high co-change frequency suggests that changes to `ImageUtil.java` often coincide with changes to `ImageLinkTag.java`, making it a priority for synchronized modifications.\n\n2. **ImageMetadata.java**: With a conceptual coupling score of 0.853, this entity shares a strong semantic relationship with `ImageUtil.java`. Additionally, it has a considerable support count (8) and confidence (0.444). The combination of these factors indicates that `ImageMetadata.java` is likely to require changes alongside `ImageUtil.java`.\n\n3. **LinkUtil.java**: It has a moderate support count (4) and confidence (0.222), suggesting some degree of co-change likelihood with `ImageUtil.java`. However, without additional evidence of coupling dependencies or conceptual similarity, its priority for synchronization is lower compared to the top two.\n\n4. **ParserFunctionUtil.java**: Similar to `LinkUtil.java`, it has a support count of 4 and confidence of 0.222. This indicates that it might be changed together with `ImageUtil.java`, but the need for synchronization is not as strong as for the first two entities.\n\n5. **JAMHTMLConverter.java**: This entity also shares a support count of 4 and confidence of 0.222 with `ImageUtil.java`. While it shows up in the co-change history, the lack of other evidence supporting a strong dependency makes its necessity for synchronized changes less critical.\n\n6. **ServletUtil.java**: With a support count of 2 and confidence of 0.111, `ServletUtil.java` appears less frequently in co-changes with `ImageUtil.java`. Nonetheless, given its presence in the co-change list, it should still be considered for potential impact analysis.\n\n7. **WikiPageInfo.java**: Lastly, `WikiPageInfo.java` has a support count of 3 and confidence of 0.167. Though it has slightly higher confidence than `ServletUtil.java`, the overall low frequency of co-changes means it is the least likely to require synchronized modifications among the entities listed.\n\nThe elements in the Change set are sorted in descending order of the likelihood of synchronized modifications based on the support count and confidence from the co-change relationship, along with any additional insights gained from examining coupling dependencies and conceptual similarities.",

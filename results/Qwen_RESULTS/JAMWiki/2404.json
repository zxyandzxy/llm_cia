This suggests that changes to `WikiUserDetails.java` might necessitate changes to `JAMWikiDaoImpl` due to shared functionality or context within the application.\n\n2. **AnsiDataHandler**, **RegisterServlet**, **JAMWikiPostAuthenticationFilter** - Support: 2, Confidence: 0.5\n   - These entities show moderate co-change frequency with `WikiUserDetails.java`. The reasons for their co-changes could be related to common features or functionalities affecting all of them, even though there is no evidence of direct code dependencies or conceptual coupling.\n\n3. **WikiLogger**\n   - `WikiLogger` has a strong conceptual coupling with `WikiUserDetails.java`, as indicated by the high semantic similarity probability (0.85). Additionally, it is directly called from `WikiUserDetails.java` according to the call graph analysis. Therefore, any modifications to `WikiUserDetails.java` will very likely require corresponding changes to `WikiLogger` to maintain consistency and proper logging functionality.\n\nThis change set is based on the combination of historical co-change patterns and direct interaction/coupling analyses. Entities like `JAMWikiDaoImpl` and `WikiLogger` are prioritized due to their higher likelihood of requiring synchronized modifications with `WikiUserDetails.java`. Other entities listed in the co-change relationship function results may also need to be considered depending on the specific nature of the changes made to `WikiUserDetails.java`. \n\nPlease note that the remaining entities from the co-change relationship result were not included in the final change set because they either had lower support counts/confidence scores or lacked sufficient evidence of direct interaction or conceptual coupling with `WikiUserDetails.java`.

This suggests that changes to `WikiUserDetails.java` might necessitate changes to `JAMWikiDaoImpl` due to shared functionality or context within the application.\n\n2. **AnsiDataHandler**, **RegisterServlet**, **JAMWikiPostAuthenticationFilter** - Support: 2, Confidence: 0.5\n   - These entities show moderate co-change frequency with `WikiUserDetails.java`. The reasons for their co-changes could be related to common features or functionalities affecting all of them, even though there is no evidence of direct code dependencies or conceptual coupling.\n\n3. **WikiLogger**\n   - `WikiLogger` has a strong conceptual coupling with `WikiUserDetails.java`, as indicated by the high semantic similarity probability (0.85). Additionally, it is directly called from `WikiUserDetails.java` according to the call graph analysis. Therefore, any modifications to `WikiUserDetails.java` will very likely require corresponding changes to `WikiLogger` to maintain consistency and proper logging functionality.\n\nThis change set is based on the combination of historical co-change patterns and direct interaction/coupling analyses. Entities like `JAMWikiDaoImpl` and `WikiLogger` are prioritized due to their higher likelihood of requiring synchronized modifications with `WikiUserDetails.java`. Other entities listed in the co-change relationship function results may also need to be considered depending on the specific nature of the changes made to `WikiUserDetails.java`. \n\nPlease note that the remaining entities from the co-change relationship result were not included in the final change set because they either had lower support counts/confidence scores or lacked sufficient evidence of direct interaction or conceptual coupling with `WikiUserDetails.java`.

Given its appearance in the co-change history with `DiffUtil.java`, it should be considered for synchronization to avoid any unintended side effects from the code modifications.\n\n4. **LuceneSearchEngine**: With a confidence level of 0.33, this entity was also modified in conjunction with `DiffUtil.java` at least once. While there is no direct evidence of coupling or interaction, including it in the change set can help mitigate risks associated with unforeseen dependencies.\n\n5. **DiffUtilTest**: As a test class for `DiffUtil.java`, it's crucial to update `DiffUtilTest` whenever changes are made to `DiffUtil.java`.

Co-change analysis indicates that `WikiDiff` is the most relevant entity that has been modified alongside `DiffUtil.java`.\n2.

It is included in the change set as a precautionary measure to ensure that any potential ripple effects from changes in `DiffUtil.java` do not affect its functionality.\n\n3. **RecentChangesFeedServlet**: Similar to `UpgradeServlet`, it also has a confidence level of 0.33. Given its appearance in the co-change history with `DiffUtil.java`, it should be considered for synchronization to avoid any unintended side effects from the code modifications.\n\n4. **LuceneSearchEngine**: With a confidence level of 0.33, this entity was also modified in conjunction with `DiffUtil.java` at least once. While there is no direct evidence of coupling or interaction, including it in the change set can help mitigate risks associated with unforeseen dependencies.\n\n5. **DiffUtilTest**: As a test class for `DiffUtil.java`, it's crucial to update `DiffUtilTest` whenever changes are made to `DiffUtil.java`.

Additionally, there is an inheritance relationship where `EditServlet` extends `JAMWikiServlet`, making it highly likely that changes to `JAMWikiServlet.java` will require modifications in `EditServlet`.\n\n- **LoginServlet**: With 5 supports and a confidence of 0.25, this entity also shows a tendency to be modified alongside `JAMWikiServlet.java`. The inheritance relationship between `LoginServlet` and `JAMWikiServlet` further strengthens the need for synchronized changes.\n\n- **AdminServlet**: Having 6 supports and a confidence of 0.3, `AdminServlet` often changes along with `JAMWikiServlet.java`. It also inherits from `JAMWikiServlet`, which means any changes to the superclass (`JAMWikiServlet`) may necessitate changes in `AdminServlet`.\n\n- **PrintableServlet**: This entity has 5 supports and a confidence of 0.25, suggesting it is frequently changed with `JAMWikiServlet.java`. Although no specific coupling dependency was checked, its co-change frequency justifies its inclusion in the change set.\n\n- **SetupServlet**: With 5 supports and a confidence of 0.25, `SetupServlet` appears in the version history as being changed alongside `JAMWikiServlet.java`. Like `PrintableServlet`, while no direct coupling dependency check was performed, its frequent co-change suggests a potential need for synchronization.\n\n- **Utilities**: This utility class is directly referenced by `JAMWikiServlet.java` according to the call graph analysis. Changes in `JAMWikiServlet.java` might affect how `Utilities` are used or vice versa, so keeping them synchronized is important.\n\n- **RegisterServlet**: This entity has 5 supports and a confidence of 0.25, and although no coupling dependency was explicitly checked, its co-change frequency suggests it should be considered for synchronized modification.\n\n- **SearchServlet**: With 4 supports and a confidence of 0.2, this entity has a moderate chance of requiring changes when `JAMWikiServlet.java` is modified. It's included based on co-change frequency.\n\n- **SaveAttachmentServlet**: It has 3 supports and a confidence of 0.15, and while not directly coupled, its co-change history suggests it could need updates.\n\n- **FileHandler**: Also having 3 supports and a confidence of 0.15, `FileHandler` is included due to its co-change pattern with `JAMWikiServlet.java`.\n\n- **WikiPageInfo**: This entity has 2 supports and a confidence of 0.1, but given its co-change history, it's worth considering for synchronization.\n\n- **TranslationServlet**: Finally, with 2 supports and a confidence of 0.1, `TranslationServlet` rounds out the list of entities that should be reviewed for potential changes when modifying `JAMWikiServlet.java`.\n\nThe elements in the Change set are sorted in descending order of the likelihood of synchronized modifications based on the support count and confidence levels provided by the `get_co_change_relationship` function, as well as the explicit coupling dependencies identified through inheritance relationships.

Additionally, there is an inheritance relationship where `EditServlet` extends `JAMWikiServlet`, making it highly likely that changes to `JAMWikiServlet.java` will require modifications in `EditServlet`.\n\n- **LoginServlet**: With 5 supports and a confidence of 0.25, this entity also shows a tendency to be modified alongside `JAMWikiServlet.java`. The inheritance relationship between `LoginServlet` and `JAMWikiServlet` further strengthens the need for synchronized changes.\n\n- **AdminServlet**: Having 6 supports and a confidence of 0.3, `AdminServlet` often changes along with `JAMWikiServlet.java`. It also inherits from `JAMWikiServlet`, which means any changes to the superclass (`JAMWikiServlet`) may necessitate changes in `AdminServlet`.\n\n- **PrintableServlet**: This entity has 5 supports and a confidence of 0.25, suggesting it is frequently changed with `JAMWikiServlet.java`. Although no specific coupling dependency was checked, its co-change frequency justifies its inclusion in the change set.\n\n- **SetupServlet**: With 5 supports and a confidence of 0.25, `SetupServlet` appears in the version history as being changed alongside `JAMWikiServlet.java`. Like `PrintableServlet`, while no direct coupling dependency check was performed, its frequent co-change suggests a potential need for synchronization.\n\n- **Utilities**: This utility class is directly referenced by `JAMWikiServlet.java` according to the call graph analysis. Changes in `JAMWikiServlet.java` might affect how `Utilities` are used or vice versa, so keeping them synchronized is important.\n\n- **RegisterServlet**: This entity has 5 supports and a confidence of 0.25, and although no coupling dependency was explicitly checked, its co-change frequency suggests it should be considered for synchronized modification.\n\n- **SearchServlet**: With 4 supports and a confidence of 0.2, this entity has a moderate chance of requiring changes when `JAMWikiServlet.java` is modified. It's included based on co-change frequency.\n\n- **SaveAttachmentServlet**: It has 3 supports and a confidence of 0.15, and while not directly coupled, its co-change history suggests it could need updates.\n\n- **FileHandler**: Also having 3 supports and a confidence of 0.15, `FileHandler` is included due to its co-change pattern with `JAMWikiServlet.java`.\n\n- **WikiPageInfo**: This entity has 2 supports and a confidence of 0.1, but given its co-change history, it's worth considering for synchronization.\n\n- **TranslationServlet**: Finally, with 2 supports and a confidence of 0.1, `TranslationServlet` rounds out the list of entities that should be reviewed for potential changes when modifying `JAMWikiServlet.java`.\n\nThe elements in the Change set are sorted in descending order of the likelihood of synchronized modifications based on the support count and confidence levels provided by the `get_co_change_relationship` function, as well as the explicit coupling dependencies identified through inheritance relationships.

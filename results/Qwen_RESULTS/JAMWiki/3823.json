Although there are no direct coupling dependencies or call graph connections, it has a high conceptual similarity with `ResourceUtil.java`, indicating that they share a strong semantic relationship. Changes to `ResourceUtil.java` are very likely to require changes to `WikiConfiguration.java`.\n\n2. **SpamFilter.java**: It has been modified 3 out of 4 times when `ResourceUtil.java` was changed (confidence 0.75). The conceptual similarity between these two entities is even higher than that of `WikiConfiguration.java`, with a probability of approximately 0.891. This suggests that `SpamFilter.java` should also be considered for synchronized changes.\n\n3. **Environment.java**: This entity appears in the co-change list with a support count of 2 and a confidence of 0.5. While the conceptual coupling was not checked specifically, its presence in the co-change list indicates some level of relatedness, though less than that of `WikiConfiguration.java` and `SpamFilter.java`.\n\n4. **WikiUtil.java**: Similarly to `Environment.java`, this entity has been co-changed 2 times (confidence 0.5). Its inclusion in the change set is based on the co-change relationship, which implies a certain degree of dependency on modifications in `ResourceUtil.java`.\n\n5. **TestFileUtil.java**: With a support count of 2 and a confidence of 0.5, this test utility file seems to have a connection to `ResourceUtil.java` through co-changes. However, since it's a test file, its synchronization might be more relevant in testing scenarios rather than production code changes.\n\n6. **ServletUtil.java**: This utility class for servlet operations is also part of the co-change list with similar metrics as the previous two entities. It could be involved in the same functional area or layer as `ResourceUtil.java`.\n\n7. **DatabaseConnection.java**: Like the other entities with a confidence of 0.5, `DatabaseConnection.java` might need to be synchronized due to its involvement in the same or closely related functionality that affects `ResourceUtil.java`.\n\nThe elements in the Change set are sorted in descending order of the likelihood of synchronized modifications, starting with those having the strongest evidence of needing synchronization based on their co-change relationship and conceptual coupling.",

Although there are no direct coupling dependencies or call graph connections, it has a high conceptual similarity with `ResourceUtil.java`, indicating that they share a strong semantic relationship. Changes to `ResourceUtil.java` are very likely to require changes to `WikiConfiguration.java`.\n\n2. **SpamFilter.java**: It has been modified 3 out of 4 times when `ResourceUtil.java` was changed (confidence 0.75). The conceptual similarity between these two entities is even higher than that of `WikiConfiguration.java`, with a probability of approximately 0.891. This suggests that `SpamFilter.java` should also be considered for synchronized changes.\n\n3. **Environment.java**: This entity appears in the co-change list with a support count of 2 and a confidence of 0.5. While the conceptual coupling was not checked specifically, its presence in the co-change list indicates some level of relatedness, though less than that of `WikiConfiguration.java` and `SpamFilter.java`.\n\n4. **WikiUtil.java**: Similarly to `Environment.java`, this entity has been co-changed 2 times (confidence 0.5). Its inclusion in the change set is based on the co-change relationship, which implies a certain degree of dependency on modifications in `ResourceUtil.java`.\n\n5. **TestFileUtil.java**: With a support count of 2 and a confidence of 0.5, this test utility file seems to have a connection to `ResourceUtil.java` through co-changes. However, since it's a test file, its synchronization might be more relevant in testing scenarios rather than production code changes.\n\n6. **ServletUtil.java**: This utility class for servlet operations is also part of the co-change list with similar metrics as the previous two entities. It could be involved in the same functional area or layer as `ResourceUtil.java`.\n\n7. **DatabaseConnection.java**: Like the other entities with a confidence of 0.5, `DatabaseConnection.java` might need to be synchronized due to its involvement in the same or closely related functionality that affects `ResourceUtil.java`.\n\nThe elements in the Change set are sorted in descending order of the likelihood of synchronized modifications, starting with those having the strongest evidence of needing synchronization based on their co-change relationship and conceptual coupling.",

In order to help solve the CIA mission, you should first understand some necessary concepts\uff1a\n(1)entity: Entities represent source code files in CIA tasks, and all the CIA tasks under study are based on the Java language, so entities are files with the .java extension.\n(2)starting entity: The starting entity is also called salient entity, and the salient entity is the root change that causes the modification of the rest of entities in a change set, while the rest of entities are the dependency modification along with the salient one.\nYou will be presented with a starting entity and tools (functions) will be provided to access the more information of the origin system. Your task is to gradually explain which entity really need to be synchronized, based on the starting entity and the information obtained through the function-call. You have 7 chances to call the function to get more information."

This means that `EditServlet.java` is also closely related to `ServletUtil.java` in terms of functionality or purpose, further supporting the need to synchronize this file when changes are made to `ServletUtil.java`.\n\nTo summarize our findings:\n\n1. **Utilities.java**: We found both co-change relationships and significant conceptual coupling with `ServletUtil.java`, making it essential to synchronize.\n2. **UploadServlet.java**: There is a strong historical co-change relationship and a very high conceptual coupling score, indicating it should be synchronized as well.\n3. **EditServlet.java**: Similarly, there's a strong co-change relationship and an even higher conceptual coupling, meaning it too should be considered for synchronization.\n\nTherefore, based on the analysis using co-change relationships, call graphs, and conceptual couplings, the entities that really need to be synchronized with changes to `ServletUtil.java` are:\n- `Utilities.java`\n- `UploadServlet.java`\n- `EditServlet.java`\n\nThese files have shown either direct interactions or strong conceptual similarities, suggesting that modifications to `ServletUtil.java` would likely impact these entities as well.",

Although it does not appear in the call graph, it might share common functionality or context with WikiUtil.\n\n3. **WikiDatabase** - Support: 3, Confidence: 0.15\n   WikiDatabase shows up as a co-change candidate with a moderate level of support and confidence. Its inclusion in the change set is justified by its frequent appearance alongside WikiUtil in past changes, suggesting potential dependencies or shared responsibilities within the application.\n\n4. **JAMWikiServlet** - Support: 3, Confidence: 0.15\n   Similar to WikiDatabase, JAMWikiServlet has been changed together with WikiUtil three times out of ten changes of WikiUtil. This implies that they might be part of the same functional area or have interdependencies that necessitate concurrent modifications.\n\n5. **WikiBase** - Conceptual Coupling: 0.8638281\n   Although WikiBase does not show direct coupling dependencies with WikiUtil, the high conceptual similarity score suggests that these two entities are closely related in purpose and functionality.

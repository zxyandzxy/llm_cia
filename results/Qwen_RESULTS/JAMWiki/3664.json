In order to help solve the CIA mission, you should first understand some necessary concepts\uff1a\n(1)entity: Entities represent source code files in CIA tasks, and all the CIA tasks under study are based on the Java language, so entities are files with the .java extension.\n(2)starting entity: The starting entity is also called salient entity, and the salient entity is the root change that causes the modification of the rest of entities in a change set, while the rest of entities are the dependency modification along with the salient one.\nYou will be presented with a starting entity and tools (functions) will be provided to access the more information of the origin system. Your task is to gradually explain which entity really need to be synchronized, based on the starting entity and the information obtained through the function-call. You have 7 chances to call the function to get more information."

Although there are no direct coupling dependencies between them, they have been frequently changed together as indicated by the high co-change frequency and confidence values. Therefore, it is highly likely that changes to `WikiUtil.java` will necessitate changes to `ServletUtil`.\n\n2. **AdminServlet**: With a support count of 4 and a confidence of 0.2, `AdminServlet` is often modified alongside `WikiUtil.java`. This suggests a significant relationship where changes to `WikiUtil.java` may impact `AdminServlet`, or vice versa, making it crucial to consider this servlet for synchronization.\n\n3. **WikiBase**: This entity is directly called by `WikiUtil.java` and has a support count of 2 with a confidence of 0.1. Given its direct interaction with `WikiUtil.java`, any modifications to `WikiUtil.java` could affect `WikiBase`'s functionality, hence requiring careful consideration for synchronized changes.\n\n4. **WikiVersion**: Similarly to `WikiBase`, `WikiVersion` is also directly called by `WikiUtil.java` and has a support count of 1 with a confidence of 0.05.

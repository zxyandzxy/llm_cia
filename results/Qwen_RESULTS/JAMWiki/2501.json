Additionally, there are direct method calls from `DiffUtil.java` to `WikiDiff`, and coupling dependencies exist where instances of `WikiDiff` are created and used within methods of `DiffUtil.java`. Therefore, it is highly likely that any modifications to `DiffUtil.java` will require corresponding changes in `WikiDiff`.\n\n2. **UpgradeServlet**: Although the support count is only 1, indicating this file was changed once when `DiffUtil.java` was modified, the confidence level is 0.33. It suggests a lower likelihood of requiring synchronization but still possible. Further investigation may be needed to confirm if changes in `DiffUtil.java` would necessitate changes here.\n\n3. **RecentChangesFeedServlet**: Similar to `UpgradeServlet`, it shares the same confidence level of 0.33 with a support count of 1. The low confidence indicates it's less likely to need synchronization with `DiffUtil.java`, but because they have been changed together before, it cannot be completely ruled out.\n\n4. **LuceneSearchEngine**: This entity also has a support count of 1 and a confidence level of 0.33. Despite the low probability, its past change alongside `DiffUtil.java` warrants consideration for potential synchronization needs.\n\n5. **DiffUtilTest**: As a test class associated with `DiffUtil.java`, it's logical that changes in `DiffUtil.java` could lead to necessary updates in its corresponding tests. With a support count of 1 and a confidence level of 0.33, it should be considered for synchronization to ensure the test cases remain valid after code modifications.\n\nIn summary, entities in the change set are sorted in descending order of the likelihood of synchronized modifications, with `WikiDiff` being the most critical followed by others with decreasing probabilities based on their co-change relationships and functional interdependencies with `DiffUtil.java`.",

Additionally, there are direct method calls from `DiffUtil.java` to `WikiDiff`, and coupling dependencies exist where instances of `WikiDiff` are created and used within methods of `DiffUtil.java`. Therefore, it is highly likely that any modifications to `DiffUtil.java` will require corresponding changes in `WikiDiff`.\n\n2. **UpgradeServlet**: Although the support count is only 1, indicating this file was changed once when `DiffUtil.java` was modified, the confidence level is 0.33. It suggests a lower likelihood of requiring synchronization but still possible. Further investigation may be needed to confirm if changes in `DiffUtil.java` would necessitate changes here.\n\n3. **RecentChangesFeedServlet**: Similar to `UpgradeServlet`, it shares the same confidence level of 0.33 with a support count of 1. The low confidence indicates it's less likely to need synchronization with `DiffUtil.java`, but because they have been changed together before, it cannot be completely ruled out.\n\n4. **LuceneSearchEngine**: This entity also has a support count of 1 and a confidence level of 0.33. Despite the low probability, its past change alongside `DiffUtil.java` warrants consideration for potential synchronization needs.\n\n5. **DiffUtilTest**: As a test class associated with `DiffUtil.java`, it's logical that changes in `DiffUtil.java` could lead to necessary updates in its corresponding tests. With a support count of 1 and a confidence level of 0.33, it should be considered for synchronization to ensure the test cases remain valid after code modifications.\n\nIn summary, entities in the change set are sorted in descending order of the likelihood of synchronized modifications, with `WikiDiff` being the most critical followed by others with decreasing probabilities based on their co-change relationships and functional interdependencies with `DiffUtil.java`.",

Other entities like `ImageMetadata.java`, `ImageUtilTest.java`, and `UploadServlet.java` have also been modified along with `ImageUtil.java` but to a lesser extent.\n\nNext, let's delve deeper into understanding why these files are co-changed by looking at their coupling dependencies or call relationships.

Such a strong conceptual relationship can explain why they have been frequently changed together in the past.\n\nConsidering this information, it would be prudent to include `ImageLinkTag.java` in any synchronization changes when modifying `ImageUtil.java`.

However, without further evidence of direct interaction, this decision would be based on the assumption that these entities are part of a cohesive module within the application.\n\nIn conclusion, based on our analysis so far, when making changes to `ImageUtil.java`, you should consider synchronizing changes with `ImageLinkTag.java` due to their strong conceptual coupling and historical co-change pattern.

Although there are no direct coupling dependencies or method calls between these two entities, they exhibit a strong conceptual coupling with a semantic similarity probability of 0.86. Therefore, changes to `ImageUtil.java` should be accompanied by changes to `ImageLinkTag.java`.\n\n2. **ImageMetadata.java**: With a support count of 8 and confidence of 0.44, this entity is frequently modified alongside `ImageUtil.java`. While there are no coupling dependencies detected, it's likely that `ImageMetadata.java` shares a functional relationship with `ImageUtil.java`, possibly being involved in similar operations or workflows.\n\n3. **ImageUtilTest.java**: This test class for `ImageUtil.java` has been changed together with its corresponding source file 5 times, giving it a confidence of 0.28. It's important to update the tests whenever the implementation changes to ensure that the tests remain valid and comprehensive.\n\n4. **WikiPageInfo.java**: This entity has a support count of 3 and a confidence of 0.17. It may share some interaction with `ImageUtil.java` within the system, although no direct coupling was found. Its inclusion in the change set is based on the moderate co-change frequency.\n\n5. **JAMHTMLConverter.java**: This entity also shows a co-change pattern with `ImageUtil.java` with a support count of 4 and a confidence of 0.22. There might be indirect interactions between these two entities that could necessitate concurrent updates.\n\n6. **ParserFunctionUtil.java**: Having a support count of 4 and confidence of 0.22, this entity is another candidate for synchronization. Although there is no evidence of direct coupling, it may still be affected by changes to `ImageUtil.java`.\n\n7. **LinkUtil.java**: Finally, `LinkUtil.java` appears in the co-change history with `ImageUtil.java` 4 times, providing a confidence of 0.22. Similar to other entities in this list, it should be considered for synchronization due to its frequent co-change occurrence.\n\nIn summary, when making changes to `ImageUtil.java`, you should consider synchronizing changes with the above-listed entities in the given order, prioritizing those with higher support counts and confidence levels.

Although there are no direct coupling dependencies or method calls between these two entities, they exhibit a strong conceptual coupling with a semantic similarity probability of 0.86. Therefore, changes to `ImageUtil.java` should be accompanied by changes to `ImageLinkTag.java`.\n\n2. **ImageMetadata.java**: With a support count of 8 and confidence of 0.44, this entity is frequently modified alongside `ImageUtil.java`. While there are no coupling dependencies detected, it's likely that `ImageMetadata.java` shares a functional relationship with `ImageUtil.java`, possibly being involved in similar operations or workflows.\n\n3. **ImageUtilTest.java**: This test class for `ImageUtil.java` has been changed together with its corresponding source file 5 times, giving it a confidence of 0.28. It's important to update the tests whenever the implementation changes to ensure that the tests remain valid and comprehensive.\n\n4. **WikiPageInfo.java**: This entity has a support count of 3 and a confidence of 0.17. It may share some interaction with `ImageUtil.java` within the system, although no direct coupling was found. Its inclusion in the change set is based on the moderate co-change frequency.\n\n5. **JAMHTMLConverter.java**: This entity also shows a co-change pattern with `ImageUtil.java` with a support count of 4 and a confidence of 0.22. There might be indirect interactions between these two entities that could necessitate concurrent updates.\n\n6. **ParserFunctionUtil.java**: Having a support count of 4 and confidence of 0.22, this entity is another candidate for synchronization. Although there is no evidence of direct coupling, it may still be affected by changes to `ImageUtil.java`.\n\n7. **LinkUtil.java**: Finally, `LinkUtil.java` appears in the co-change history with `ImageUtil.java` 4 times, providing a confidence of 0.22. Similar to other entities in this list, it should be considered for synchronization due to its frequent co-change occurrence.\n\nIn summary, when making changes to `ImageUtil.java`, you should consider synchronizing changes with the above-listed entities in the given order, prioritizing those with higher support counts and confidence levels.

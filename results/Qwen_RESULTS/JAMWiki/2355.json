Changes in user detail handling may require adjustments to how groups are managed.\n\n9. **WikiLogger**: Logging functionality provided by `WikiLogger` and used by `WikiUserDetails.java` may need updates if logging requirements change as part of modifications to user details management.\n\n10. **WikiBase**: This foundational component is also directly referenced by `WikiUserDetails.java`.

Given its role in user registration processes, it may have indirect interactions with `WikiUserDetails.java`, especially if changes involve user account management.\n\n3. **AnsiDataHandler**: Also appearing in the co-change list with a support count of 2 and confidence of 0.5, this handler might be involved in processing data relevant to user details during certain operations, making it a candidate for synchronized changes.\n\n4. **JAMWikiPostAuthenticationFilter**: With a support count of 2 and confidence of 0.5, this filter is likely to interact with user authentication and authorization workflows that involve `WikiUserDetails.java`.\n\n5. **WikiUser**: The conceptual coupling between `WikiUserDetails.java` and `WikiUser` is very strong (0.89), suggesting they share similar functionality related to user management.

Any modifications affecting user permissions or roles in `WikiUserDetails.java` would likely impact `Role`.\n\n7. **WikiUtil**: As a utility class used by `WikiUserDetails.java`, any changes that affect how user details are processed or accessed could require corresponding changes in `WikiUtil`.\n\n8. **WikiGroup**: Directly called by `WikiUserDetails.java`, this entity manages group membership, which is closely tied to user details. Changes in user detail handling may require adjustments to how groups are managed.\n\n9. **WikiLogger**: Logging functionality provided by `WikiLogger` and used by `WikiUserDetails.java` may need updates if logging requirements change as part of modifications to user details management.\n\n10. **WikiBase**: This foundational component is also directly referenced by `WikiUserDetails.java`.

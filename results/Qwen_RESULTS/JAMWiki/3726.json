Entities directly called by `WikiDatabase.java`: `TopicVersion`, `Environment`, `WikiMessage`, `DataHandler`, `Topic`, `WikiUtil`, `Role`, `VirtualWiki`, `WikiUser`, `Encryption`, `WikiBase`, `WikiLogger`, `WikiGroup`.\n2.

Additionally, it has a high conceptual coupling (semantic similarity probability of 0.869), indicating that they share similar functionality or features.\n\n2. **AdminServlet**: This entity has a support count of 7 and confidence of 0.5, making it another strong candidate for synchronization due to its frequent appearance alongside changes in `WikiDatabase.java`.\n\n3. **DatabaseUpgrades**: With a support count of 6 and confidence of 0.429, this entity often changes along with `WikiDatabase.java` and might be involved in database-related updates or migrations.\n\n4. **Role**: It has a moderate support count of 3 and confidence of 0.214, but it also appears in the call graph of `WikiDatabase.java`, which increases the likelihood of needing synchronization.\n\n5. **WikiBase**: Although it has a low confidence level of 0.143, it appears in both the co-change list and the call graph of `WikiDatabase.java`, suggesting it may need to be updated when changes occur in `WikiDatabase.java`.\n\n6. **WikiLogger**: Similar to `WikiBase`, it has a low confidence level but is part of the call graph and co-change list, implying potential interdependencies.\n\n7. **TopicVersion**, **Environment**, **WikiMessage**, **DataHandler**, **Topic**, **WikiUtil**, **VirtualWiki**, **WikiUser**, **Encryption**, **WikiGroup**: These entities are included because they are directly referenced by `WikiDatabase.java` through method calls or variable references, indicating that any changes to `WikiDatabase.java` could affect these files.\n\nIn conclusion, the first four entities (UpgradeServlet, AdminServlet, DatabaseUpgrades, Role) should be prioritized for synchronization based on their strong co-change history and conceptual coupling.

Additionally, it has a high conceptual coupling (semantic similarity probability of 0.869), indicating that they share similar functionality or features.\n\n2. **AdminServlet**: This entity has a support count of 7 and confidence of 0.5, making it another strong candidate for synchronization due to its frequent appearance alongside changes in `WikiDatabase.java`.\n\n3. **DatabaseUpgrades**: With a support count of 6 and confidence of 0.429, this entity often changes along with `WikiDatabase.java` and might be involved in database-related updates or migrations.\n\n4. **Role**: It has a moderate support count of 3 and confidence of 0.214, but it also appears in the call graph of `WikiDatabase.java`, which increases the likelihood of needing synchronization.\n\n5. **WikiBase**: Although it has a low confidence level of 0.143, it appears in both the co-change list and the call graph of `WikiDatabase.java`, suggesting it may need to be updated when changes occur in `WikiDatabase.java`.\n\n6. **WikiLogger**: Similar to `WikiBase`, it has a low confidence level but is part of the call graph and co-change list, implying potential interdependencies.\n\n7. **TopicVersion**, **Environment**, **WikiMessage**, **DataHandler**, **Topic**, **WikiUtil**, **VirtualWiki**, **WikiUser**, **Encryption**, **WikiGroup**: These entities are included because they are directly referenced by `WikiDatabase.java` through method calls or variable references, indicating that any changes to `WikiDatabase.java` could affect these files.\n\nIn conclusion, the first four entities (UpgradeServlet, AdminServlet, DatabaseUpgrades, Role) should be prioritized for synchronization based on their strong co-change history and conceptual coupling.

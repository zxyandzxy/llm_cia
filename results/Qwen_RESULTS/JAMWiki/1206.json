In order to help solve the CIA mission, you should first understand some necessary concepts\uff1a\n(1)entity: Entities represent source code files in CIA tasks, and all the CIA tasks under study are based on the Java language, so entities are files with the .java extension.\n(2)starting entity: The starting entity is also called salient entity, and the salient entity is the root change that causes the modification of the rest of entities in a change set, while the rest of entities are the dependency modification along with the salient one.\nYou will be presented with a starting entity and tools (functions) will be provided to access the more information of the origin system. Your task is to gradually explain which entity really need to be synchronized, based on the starting entity and the information obtained through the function-call. You have 7 chances to call the function to get more information."

Changes in `TopicServlet.java` should thus also be synchronized with `ImagesServlet.java`.\n- **WikiLogger**: This entity is directly used by `TopicServlet.java` as indicated by the call graph. Since modifications to `TopicServlet.java` might affect how logging is handled, any related changes should be synchronized with `WikiLogger`.\n- **Pagination**: Being part of the call graph for `TopicServlet.java`, changes in pagination logic within `TopicServlet.java` could require corresponding changes in the `Pagination` class.\n- **Utilities**: As this utility class is called by `TopicServlet.java`, updates to the servlet may necessitate changes in `Utilities` to maintain consistent functionality.\n- **Topic**: Given that `TopicServlet.java` deals with topics, it's logical that any changes affecting topic handling should be reflected in the `Topic` entity as well.\n- **WikiMessage**: If `TopicServlet.java` uses `WikiMessage` for displaying messages or errors, then any changes to message-handling code should be synchronized with `WikiMessage`.\n- **VirtualWiki**: The use of `VirtualWiki` in `TopicServlet.java` suggests that changes impacting virtual wikis need to be propagated to `VirtualWiki`.\n- **WikiBase**: Since `WikiBase` is referenced by `TopicServlet.java`, changes in the base wiki functionalities should be synchronized to ensure compatibility and consistency.\n\nThe elements in the Change set are sorted in descending order of the likelihood of synchronized modifications based on the strength of their conceptual coupling and evidence from co-changes.

Changes in `TopicServlet.java` should thus also be synchronized with `ImagesServlet.java`.\n- **WikiLogger**: This entity is directly used by `TopicServlet.java` as indicated by the call graph. Since modifications to `TopicServlet.java` might affect how logging is handled, any related changes should be synchronized with `WikiLogger`.\n- **Pagination**: Being part of the call graph for `TopicServlet.java`, changes in pagination logic within `TopicServlet.java` could require corresponding changes in the `Pagination` class.\n- **Utilities**: As this utility class is called by `TopicServlet.java`, updates to the servlet may necessitate changes in `Utilities` to maintain consistent functionality.\n- **Topic**: Given that `TopicServlet.java` deals with topics, it's logical that any changes affecting topic handling should be reflected in the `Topic` entity as well.\n- **WikiMessage**: If `TopicServlet.java` uses `WikiMessage` for displaying messages or errors, then any changes to message-handling code should be synchronized with `WikiMessage`.\n- **VirtualWiki**: The use of `VirtualWiki` in `TopicServlet.java` suggests that changes impacting virtual wikis need to be propagated to `VirtualWiki`.\n- **WikiBase**: Since `WikiBase` is referenced by `TopicServlet.java`, changes in the base wiki functionalities should be synchronized to ensure compatibility and consistency.\n\nThe elements in the Change set are sorted in descending order of the likelihood of synchronized modifications based on the strength of their conceptual coupling and evidence from co-changes.

Given this close relationship, it is highly likely that any changes to `IncludeOnlyTag.java` would necessitate similar modifications in `NoIncludeTag.java` to ensure consistency and avoid discrepancies within the codebase.\n\n- OnlyIncludeTag.java: Although the co-change analysis revealed that `IncludeOnlyTag.java` and `OnlyIncludeTag.java` have been changed together only once, their semantic similarity probability of about 0.975 is still very significant. This implies that despite the lack of direct coupling dependencies, these two entities serve similar purposes or belong to the same feature set, making it essential to synchronize their updates whenever one undergoes changes.\n\nThe elements in the Change set are sorted in descending order of the likelihood of synchronized modifications based on the confidence level from the co-change relationship and the strength of conceptual coupling. Thus, `NoIncludeTag.java` comes first in the list as it has the highest conceptual similarity with `IncludeOnlyTag.java`.

Given this close relationship, it is highly likely that any changes to `IncludeOnlyTag.java` would necessitate similar modifications in `NoIncludeTag.java` to ensure consistency and avoid discrepancies within the codebase.\n\n- OnlyIncludeTag.java: Although the co-change analysis revealed that `IncludeOnlyTag.java` and `OnlyIncludeTag.java` have been changed together only once, their semantic similarity probability of about 0.975 is still very significant. This implies that despite the lack of direct coupling dependencies, these two entities serve similar purposes or belong to the same feature set, making it essential to synchronize their updates whenever one undergoes changes.\n\nThe elements in the Change set are sorted in descending order of the likelihood of synchronized modifications based on the confidence level from the co-change relationship and the strength of conceptual coupling.

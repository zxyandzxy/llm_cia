Furthermore, the high conceptual coupling probability of 0.837 suggests a significant semantic relationship between these two entities. Therefore, any changes made to `RegisterServlet.java` would likely require corresponding changes in `WikiUser`.\n\n2. **LoginServlet**: Although there is no direct coupling dependency found between `RegisterServlet.java` and `LoginServlet`, the co-change analysis shows that they were modified together once out of two changes, giving a confidence level of 0.5. Given that both servlets deal with user authentication processes, it's reasonable to consider `LoginServlet` for potential synchronization.\n\n3. **DiffServlet**: Similar to `LoginServlet`, `DiffServlet` appeared in one co-change event out of two total changes related to `RegisterServlet.java`, also with a confidence level of 0.5. While there might not be a direct functional relationship, considering the co-change history, it may still need to be reviewed for potential modifications.\n\n4. **ContributionsServlet**: Like `LoginServlet` and `DiffServlet`, this entity also shares a co-change relationship with `RegisterServlet.java` based on the version history. With a support count of 1 and a confidence level of 0.5, it should be considered in case its functionality is interconnected with `RegisterServlet.java` in ways not directly evident from the coupling dependencies.\n\nIn conclusion, while `WikiUser` clearly stands out as needing synchronization due to its tight integration with `RegisterServlet.java`, the other servlets (`LoginServlet`, `DiffServlet`, and `ContributionsServlet`) should also be reviewed because of their historical co-change patterns.

Furthermore, the high conceptual coupling probability of 0.837 suggests a significant semantic relationship between these two entities. Therefore, any changes made to `RegisterServlet.java` would likely require corresponding changes in `WikiUser`.\n\n2. **LoginServlet**: Although there is no direct coupling dependency found between `RegisterServlet.java` and `LoginServlet`, the co-change analysis shows that they were modified together once out of two changes, giving a confidence level of 0.5. Given that both servlets deal with user authentication processes, it's reasonable to consider `LoginServlet` for potential synchronization.\n\n3. **DiffServlet**: Similar to `LoginServlet`, `DiffServlet` appeared in one co-change event out of two total changes related to `RegisterServlet.java`, also with a confidence level of 0.5. While there might not be a direct functional relationship, considering the co-change history, it may still need to be reviewed for potential modifications.\n\n4. **ContributionsServlet**: Like `LoginServlet` and `DiffServlet`, this entity also shares a co-change relationship with `RegisterServlet.java` based on the version history. With a support count of 1 and a confidence level of 0.5, it should be considered in case its functionality is interconnected with `RegisterServlet.java` in ways not directly evident from the coupling dependencies.\n\nIn conclusion, while `WikiUser` clearly stands out as needing synchronization due to its tight integration with `RegisterServlet.java`, the other servlets (`LoginServlet`, `DiffServlet`, and `ContributionsServlet`) should also be reviewed because of their historical co-change patterns.

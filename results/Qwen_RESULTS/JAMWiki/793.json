High conceptual coupling suggests that changes in one entity might require careful consideration of the other due to their shared context or functionality.\n\nBased on our findings so far:\n\n1. `DatabaseHandler.java` has frequently been modified alongside `Topic.java`, with a confidence level of 0.61.\n2.

Although there are no direct coupling dependencies or call graph connections, the high conceptual coupling (semantic similarity probability of 0.84) indicates that changes in `Topic.java` are likely to require corresponding adjustments in `DatabaseHandler`.\n\n2. **DefaultQueryHandler**: This entity has a moderate confidence level of 0.33 for co-change with `Topic.java`, suggesting it may share some common functionality or context and should be reviewed when modifying `Topic.java`.\n\n3. **FileHandler** and **PersistencyHandler**: Both entities have a confidence level of approximately 0.39, indicating they are often changed together with `Topic.java`. While there is no direct coupling evidence, their frequent co-occurrence in change sets suggests potential ripple effects.\n\n4. **EditServlet**: With a confidence level of 0.44, this servlet is another candidate for synchronization.

Although there are no direct coupling dependencies or call graph connections, the high conceptual coupling (semantic similarity probability of 0.84) indicates that changes in `Topic.java` are likely to require corresponding adjustments in `DatabaseHandler`.\n\n2. **DefaultQueryHandler**: This entity has a moderate confidence level of 0.33 for co-change with `Topic.java`, suggesting it may share some common functionality or context and should be reviewed when modifying `Topic.java`.\n\n3. **FileHandler** and **PersistencyHandler**: Both entities have a confidence level of approximately 0.39, indicating they are often changed together with `Topic.java`.

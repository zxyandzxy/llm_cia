Your task is to gradually explain which entity really need to be synchronized, based on the starting entity and the information obtained through the function-call.

Moreover, it appears in the call graph of `WikiUtil.java`, indicating that changes to `WikiUtil.java` may require corresponding changes in `ServletUtil` to ensure consistent functionality.\n\n2. **AdminServlet**: It has 4 supports and a confidence of 0.2. Although there is no direct coupling dependency or reference in the call graph, its high co-change frequency suggests that it might be part of the same feature or module within the application that often requires concurrent changes with `WikiUtil.java`.\n\n3. **WikiLinkTag**: This entity also shows a significant co-change relationship with 3 supports and a confidence of 0.15. The absence of coupling dependencies does not rule out the possibility that it could be indirectly related to `WikiUtil.java` through shared features or common use cases.\n\n4. **Environment**: It has 3 supports and a confidence of 0.15, and importantly, it appears in the call graph of `WikiUtil.java`. Changes in `WikiUtil.java` could affect how it interacts with the environment settings, making it necessary to synchronize changes.\n\n5. **SpamFilter**: With 3 supports and a confidence of 0.15, this entity is another candidate for synchronization. Its co-change relationship indicates that it might be part of the same functional area as `WikiUtil.java`.\n\n6. **WikiDatabase**: Having 3 supports and a confidence of 0.15, `WikiDatabase` is likely involved in operations that are closely related to those performed by `WikiUtil.java`, even if there's no direct code interdependency.\n\n7. **WikiBase**: This entity has 2 supports and a confidence of 0.1. It appears in the call graph, suggesting that it plays a role in foundational operations that `WikiUtil.java` depends on.\n\n8. **JAMWikiServlet**: It shares 3 supports and a confidence of 0.15 with `WikiUtil.java`, indicating that it may be part of the same servlet-based interactions within the application.\n\n9. **LinkUtil**: With 2 supports and a confidence of 0.1, it might have some functional overlap with `WikiUtil.java`, especially given the nature of wiki applications where linking between pages is crucial.\n\n10. **ReCaptchaUtil**: Lastly, it has 2 supports and a confidence of 0.1, which means it has been modified alongside `WikiUtil.java` in the past, possibly due to security features that involve reCAPTCHA services.\n\nIn summary, entities in the change set should be considered for synchronization when modifying `WikiUtil.java` because they either show strong historical evidence of co-changes or they are directly referenced by `WikiUtil.java`'s call graph, indicating potential impacts on these files during updates or refactoring.",

Your task is to gradually explain which entity really need to be synchronized, based on the starting entity and the information obtained through the function-call.

Moreover, it appears in the call graph of `WikiUtil.java`, indicating that changes to `WikiUtil.java` may require corresponding changes in `ServletUtil` to ensure consistent functionality.\n\n2. **AdminServlet**: It has 4 supports and a confidence of 0.2. Although there is no direct coupling dependency or reference in the call graph, its high co-change frequency suggests that it might be part of the same feature or module within the application that often requires concurrent changes with `WikiUtil.java`.\n\n3. **WikiLinkTag**: This entity also shows a significant co-change relationship with 3 supports and a confidence of 0.15. The absence of coupling dependencies does not rule out the possibility that it could be indirectly related to `WikiUtil.java` through shared features or common use cases.\n\n4. **Environment**: It has 3 supports and a confidence of 0.15, and importantly, it appears in the call graph of `WikiUtil.java`. Changes in `WikiUtil.java` could affect how it interacts with the environment settings, making it necessary to synchronize changes.\n\n5. **SpamFilter**: With 3 supports and a confidence of 0.15, this entity is another candidate for synchronization.

In order to help solve the CIA mission, you should first understand some necessary concepts\uff1a\n(1)entity: Entities represent source code files in CIA tasks, and all the CIA tasks under study are based on the Java language, so entities are files with the .java extension.\n(2)starting entity: The starting entity is also called salient entity, and the salient entity is the root change that causes the modification of the rest of entities in a change set, while the rest of entities are the dependency modification along with the salient one.\nYou will be presented with a starting entity and tools (functions) will be provided to access the more information of the origin system. Your task is to gradually explain which entity really need to be synchronized, based on the starting entity and the information obtained through the function-call. You have 7 chances to call the function to get more information."

Furthermore, it has a high conceptual coupling score of 0.862, indicating a strong semantic relationship. Despite the lack of direct coupling dependencies or call graph connections, this entity is likely to require synchronization changes due to its historical co-change pattern and semantic similarity.\n\n2. **ImageMetadata**: Co-changed with `ImageUtil.java` 8 times, with a confidence level of 0.444, and a conceptual coupling score of 0.850. Like `ImageLinkTag`, there are no direct coupling dependencies between `ImageUtil.java` and `ImageMetadata`. However, their strong conceptual relationship suggests that changes to `ImageUtil.java` should prompt a review of `ImageMetadata` for possible synchronized modifications.\n\n3. **ParserFunctionUtil**: Co-changed 4 times with `ImageUtil.java`, with a confidence level of 0.222. While there is no direct evidence from coupling dependencies or call graphs, the repeated co-change occurrences indicate some indirect dependency that might warrant a change when modifying `ImageUtil.java`.\n\n4. **LinkUtil**: Similarly co-changed 4 times with `ImageUtil.java`, with the same confidence level of 0.222 as `ParserFunctionUtil`. The reason for including this entity in the change set is based on the historical co-change pattern, which suggests potential indirect dependencies or shared functional contexts.\n\n5. **JAMHTMLConverter**: Also co-changed 4 times with `ImageUtil.java`, with a confidence level of 0.222. Although there are no direct dependencies detected, its co-change history justifies consideration for synchronized changes.\n\n6. **ImageUtilTest**: Co-changed 5 times with `ImageUtil.java`, with a confidence level of 0.278. As a test class, it's common for it to be updated alongside the main codebase during refactoring or functionality changes, hence its inclusion in the change set.\n\n7. **WikiPageInfo**: Co-changed 3 times with `ImageUtil.java`, with a confidence level of 0.167. Given the lower support and confidence compared to the above entities, it is ranked lower but still included in the change set due to the historical co-change pattern.\n\n8. **JAMWikiUnitTest**: Co-changed 3 times with `ImageUtil.java`, with a confidence level of 0.167. Similar to `WikiPageInfo`, it has been included because of its co-change history, although with less certainty than the higher-ranked entities.\n\nThese entities were selected based on their co-change relationships, conceptual coupling, and confidence levels derived from historical version data.

Furthermore, it has a high conceptual coupling score of 0.862, indicating a strong semantic relationship. Despite the lack of direct coupling dependencies or call graph connections, this entity is likely to require synchronization changes due to its historical co-change pattern and semantic similarity.\n\n2. **ImageMetadata**: Co-changed with `ImageUtil.java` 8 times, with a confidence level of 0.444, and a conceptual coupling score of 0.850. Like `ImageLinkTag`, there are no direct coupling dependencies between `ImageUtil.java` and `ImageMetadata`. However, their strong conceptual relationship suggests that changes to `ImageUtil.java` should prompt a review of `ImageMetadata` for possible synchronized modifications.\n\n3. **ParserFunctionUtil**: Co-changed 4 times with `ImageUtil.java`, with a confidence level of 0.222. While there is no direct evidence from coupling dependencies or call graphs, the repeated co-change occurrences indicate some indirect dependency that might warrant a change when modifying `ImageUtil.java`.\n\n4. **LinkUtil**: Similarly co-changed 4 times with `ImageUtil.java`, with the same confidence level of 0.222 as `ParserFunctionUtil`. The reason for including this entity in the change set is based on the historical co-change pattern, which suggests potential indirect dependencies or shared functional contexts.\n\n5. **JAMHTMLConverter**: Also co-changed 4 times with `ImageUtil.java`, with a confidence level of 0.222. Although there are no direct dependencies detected, its co-change history justifies consideration for synchronized changes.\n\n6. **ImageUtilTest**: Co-changed 5 times with `ImageUtil.java`, with a confidence level of 0.278. As a test class, it's common for it to be updated alongside the main codebase during refactoring or functionality changes, hence its inclusion in the change set.\n\n7. **WikiPageInfo**: Co-changed 3 times with `ImageUtil.java`, with a confidence level of 0.167. Given the lower support and confidence compared to the above entities, it is ranked lower but still included in the change set due to the historical co-change pattern.\n\n8. **JAMWikiUnitTest**: Co-changed 3 times with `ImageUtil.java`, with a confidence level of 0.167. Similar to `WikiPageInfo`, it has been included because of its co-change history, although with less certainty than the higher-ranked entities.\n\nThese entities were selected based on their co-change relationships, conceptual coupling, and confidence levels derived from historical version data.

In order to help solve the CIA mission, you should first understand some necessary concepts\uff1a\n(1)entity: Entities represent source code files in CIA tasks, and all the CIA tasks under study are based on the Java language, so entities are files with the .java extension.\n(2)starting entity: The starting entity is also called salient entity, and the salient entity is the root change that causes the modification of the rest of entities in a change set, while the rest of entities are the dependency modification along with the salient one.\nYou will be presented with a starting entity and tools (functions) will be provided to access the more information of the origin system. Your task is to gradually explain which entity really need to be synchronized, based on the starting entity and the information obtained through the function-call. You have 7 chances to call the function to get more information."

It has a slightly lower but still significant semantic similarity probability of 0.828, suggesting a need for synchronized changes.\n\n3. **LockFile**: Although this entity has only one support and a confidence score of 0.25, it has a relatively high semantic similarity probability of 0.850.

While they have not been individually checked for conceptual coupling due to the limited number of function calls available, their appearance in the co-change history suggests some level of dependency or relevance to changes in `FileUtil.java`. These should be considered for review during any synchronization efforts, although they are less likely to require changes compared to DataFileCache, ScriptWriterBase, and LockFile.\n\nThe elements in the Change set are sorted in descending order of the likelihood of synchronized modifications based on the combination of co-change relationship supports/confidence scores and semantic similarity probabilities where available.

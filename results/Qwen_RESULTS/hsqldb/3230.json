In order to help solve the CIA mission, you should first understand some necessary concepts\uff1a\n(1)entity: Entities represent source code files in CIA tasks, and all the CIA tasks under study are based on the Java language, so entities are files with the .java extension.\n(2)starting entity: The starting entity is also called salient entity, and the salient entity is the root change that causes the modification of the rest of entities in a change set, while the rest of entities are the dependency modification along with the salient one.\nYou will be presented with a starting entity and tools (functions) will be provided to access the more information of the origin system. Your task is to gradually explain which entity really need to be synchronized, based on the starting entity and the information obtained through the function-call. You have 7 chances to call the function to get more information."

Logger.java: With 6 supports and a confidence level of 0.67, this entity has the highest likelihood of requiring synchronization with changes made to `ErrorCode.java`. The conceptual coupling score between these two entities is also high (0.783225), indicating they share significant semantic similarities.\n\n2. StatementCommand.java: This entity appears in the co-change history 3 times with `ErrorCode.java`, giving it a confidence level of 0.33. It also shows strong conceptual coupling (0.77644235) with `ErrorCode.java`.\n\n3. ParserDQL.java: This entity has been changed together with `ErrorCode.java` twice, resulting in a confidence level of 0.22. While there's no additional information on its conceptual or coupling dependencies, the co-change relationship suggests a potential need for synchronization.\n\n4. RowStoreAVL.java: Similarly to ParserDQL.java, this entity has a confidence level of 0.22 based on past co-changes. It may require attention when changes are made to `ErrorCode.java`.\n\n5. RowSetNavigatorDataTable.java: Also showing a confidence level of 0.22, this entity might be impacted by changes in `ErrorCode.java`.\n\n6. TransactionManagerCommon.java: Another entity with a confidence level of 0.22, which could indicate that it should be reviewed for possible synchronization.\n\n7. TransactionManager2PL.java: Similar reasoning applies as with the previous entities, with a confidence level of 0.22.\n\n8. RowStoreAVLDiskData.java: This entity has appeared in co-changes with `ErrorCode.java` twice, providing a confidence level of 0.22.\n\n9. TransactionManagerMVCC.java: With a confidence level of 0.22, it shares the same rationale as the others listed above.\n\n10. LobManager.java: This entity also has a confidence level of 0.22, suggesting it should be considered for potential synchronization.\n\n11. ParserDDL.java: Like other entities with a confidence level of 0.22, this entity might need to be updated alongside `ErrorCode.java`.\n\n12. StatementTypes.java: This entity has a confidence level of 0.22, and thus it is included at the lower end of the change set.\n\n13. QuerySpecification.java: Lastly, this entity has a confidence level of 0.22 and is included in the change set due to its co-change history with `ErrorCode.java`.\n\nAll entities in the change set have shown some degree of co-change with `ErrorCode.java`, and while the confidence levels are relatively low after `Logger.java` and `StatementCommand.java`, their inclusion is justified by historical data. Careful consideration should be given to each entity in the context of specific code changes to `ErrorCode.java`.",

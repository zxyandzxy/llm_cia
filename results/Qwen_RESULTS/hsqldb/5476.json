Therefore, `HashIndex` should also be synchronized when modifying `BaseHashMap`.\n\nBased on the co-change analysis and coupling dependencies, we have identified two key entities that need to be synchronized with `BaseHashMap.java`: `ValuePoolHashMap` due to inheritance and `HashIndex` due to multiple method calls and variable accesses. Considering our remaining function calls, we should now focus on other entities that might not have as strong a relationship but still appear in the co-change list.

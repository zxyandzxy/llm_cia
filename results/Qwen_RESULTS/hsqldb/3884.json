The perfect confidence score indicates that whenever `AuthFunctionUtils.java` was modified, `AuthFunctionTest.java` was also changed. Although there are no direct coupling dependencies between them, this strong historical correlation suggests that they should be synchronized to avoid potential issues.\n\n2. **AuthBeanMultiplexerTest.java**: Similar to `AuthFunctionTest.java`, this entity also shares a co-change relationship with `AuthFunctionUtils.java`. It too has been changed together with `AuthFunctionUtils.java` 2 times, yielding a confidence level of 1.0. Despite the absence of coupling dependencies, it's highly likely that changes to `AuthFunctionUtils.java` would require corresponding adjustments in `AuthBeanMultiplexerTest.java`.\n\n3. **AuthUtils.java**: The co-change relationship between `AuthFunctionUtils.java` and `AuthUtils.java` is less strong than the previous two entities, with only one instance of co-change and a confidence level of 0.5. However, it is worth noting that `AuthUtils.java` has been removed from the newer versions of the project due to iteration. As such, if your project version includes `AuthUtils.java`, it should still be considered for synchronization, albeit with lower priority compared to the other two test files.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the co-change analysis, `AuthFunctionTest.java` and `AuthBeanMultiplexerTest.java` have shown a strong correlation with `AuthFunctionUtils.java` and should be prioritized for synchronized modifications. While `AuthUtils.java` presents a weaker case for synchronization due to its removal in later iterations, it might still warrant attention depending on the specific version of the codebase you're working with.",

The perfect confidence score indicates that whenever `AuthFunctionUtils.java` was modified, `AuthFunctionTest.java` was also changed. Although there are no direct coupling dependencies between them, this strong historical correlation suggests that they should be synchronized to avoid potential issues.\n\n2. **AuthBeanMultiplexerTest.java**: Similar to `AuthFunctionTest.java`, this entity also shares a co-change relationship with `AuthFunctionUtils.java`. It too has been changed together with `AuthFunctionUtils.java` 2 times, yielding a confidence level of 1.0. Despite the absence of coupling dependencies, it's highly likely that changes to `AuthFunctionUtils.java` would require corresponding adjustments in `AuthBeanMultiplexerTest.java`.\n\n3. **AuthUtils.java**: The co-change relationship between `AuthFunctionUtils.java` and `AuthUtils.java` is less strong than the previous two entities, with only one instance of co-change and a confidence level of 0.5. However, it is worth noting that `AuthUtils.java` has been removed from the newer versions of the project due to iteration. As such, if your project version includes `AuthUtils.java`, it should still be considered for synchronization, albeit with lower priority compared to the other two test files.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the co-change analysis, `AuthFunctionTest.java` and `AuthBeanMultiplexerTest.java` have shown a strong correlation with `AuthFunctionUtils.java` and should be prioritized for synchronized modifications. While `AuthUtils.java` presents a weaker case for synchronization due to its removal in later iterations, it might still warrant attention depending on the specific version of the codebase you're working with.",

However, `DataFileCacheSession.java`, which was one of the frequently co-changed files with `DataFileCache.java`, is not included in this list.\n\nSince `DataFileCacheSession.java` is not directly called or referenced by `DataFileCache.java`, it suggests that their co-change relationship might be due to shared functionality or higher-level system behaviors rather than direct code coupling. Given the earlier co-change data, we should still consider synchronizing changes with `DataFileCacheSession.java` if the modifications impact session-related aspects of the cache.\n\nIn summary, based on our analysis:\n\n- **TextCache.java** should be synchronized due to inheritance from `DataFileCache.java`.\n- **DataFileDefrag.java** should be synchronized because it contains methods and constructor invocations that directly use instances of `DataFileCache`.\n- **DatabaseInformationFull.java** should be considered for synchronization due to high conceptual coupling.\n- **DataFileCacheSession.java** should also be considered for synchronization based on historical co-change patterns, despite the lack of direct call graph dependencies.\n\nThese entities are likely to need corresponding changes when modifying `DataFileCache.java` to maintain consistency across the system.",

Therefore, any changes to DataFileCache may necessitate changes in TextCache to maintain consistency or extend functionality.\n\n2. **DataFileDefrag.java**: This entity has direct method calls and constructor invocations with instances of DataFileCache. It is used within methods of DataFileCache, indicating a close code-level interaction that would require synchronization during changes.\n\n3. **DatabaseInformationFull.java**: Although there's no direct coupling dependency, it has a high conceptual similarity probability with DataFileCache. This suggests that these entities share similar purposes or functionalities, warranting consideration for synchronized changes.\n\n4. **DataFileCacheSession.java**: Based on historical co-change data, this entity appears frequently alongside DataFileCache.

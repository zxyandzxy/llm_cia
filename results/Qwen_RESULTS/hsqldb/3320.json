This high score indicates that despite the lack of direct coupling dependencies and calls, these two entities are conceptually related in their functionality or context within the project.\n\nThis strong conceptual relationship explains why they have been frequently co-changed in the past. It is likely that changes to the table structure or behavior (handled by `TableBase.java`) often require corresponding changes to routines involved in parsing SQL commands or specifications (handled by `ParserRoutine`), even if those changes do not manifest as direct code interdependencies.\n\nTherefore, based on our analysis so far, it is advisable to synchronize changes with `ParserRoutine` when modifying `TableBase.java`. We should also consider examining other entities with high conceptual coupling scores if further co-change relationships need to be identified.\n\nWould you like me to investigate more entities for potential synchronization, or do we have enough information to proceed with the change impact analysis?

Although there are no direct coupling dependencies or calls between them, the high conceptual coupling suggests a strong semantic relationship.\n\n2. **QuerySpecification**: Support: 1, Confidence: 0.5 - It shares some co-change history with `TableBase.java`, which might be due to their related functionalities in query processing within the database system.\n\n3. **QueryExpression**: Support: 1, Confidence: 0.5 - Similar to QuerySpecification, this entity is likely involved in query-related operations where changes to table definitions (handled by `TableBase.java`) could necessitate adjustments.\n\n4. **StatementSession**: Support: 1, Confidence: 0.5 - Changes here may be related to session management that involves tables defined in `TableBase.java`.\n\n5. **ParserCommand**: Support: 1, Confidence: 0.5 - This entity handles command parsing, and its modification might be correlated with changes in how tables are structured or accessed.\n\n6. **ParserDQL**: Support: 1, Confidence: 0.5 - As part of data query language parsing, it could have connections to table definitions managed by `TableBase.java`.\n\n7. **Routine**: Support: 1, Confidence: 0.5 - May represent stored procedures or functions that interact with tables and thus require updates alongside `TableBase.java`.\n\n8. **PersistentStoreCollectionSession**: Support: 1, Confidence: 0.5 - Deals with persistent storage sessions that may need adjustments if table structures change.\n\n9. **BaseHashMap, LongKeyHashMap**: Support: 1, Confidence: 0.5 - These utilities could be used for various internal mappings that might be affected by table structure changes.\n\n10. **ParserBase**: Support: 1, Confidence: 0.5 - A foundational parser class that might be impacted by any changes in table-related syntax or structure.\n\n11. **BlobType**: Support: 1, Confidence: 0.5 - Handles binary large objects, and its implementation details could depend on the way tables handle such types.\n\n12. **SessionContext**: Support: 1, Confidence: 0.5 - Contains contextual information about sessions that could involve table interactions.\n\nEach of these entities should be considered for synchronization during changes to `TableBase.java`.

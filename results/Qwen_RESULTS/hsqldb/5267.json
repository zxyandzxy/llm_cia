There are multiple instances where `SchemaManager.java` interacts with member variables and methods of `Database.java`. Therefore, any changes in `SchemaManager.java` could likely affect `Database.java`, making it a high-priority candidate for synchronized modifications.\n\n2. **QuerySpecification.java**: Although not directly interacting via method calls or coupling dependencies, this entity was modified alongside `SchemaManager.java` once out of eight modifications. Given its co-change history, it is worth considering for synchronization, albeit at a lower priority than `Database.java`.\n\n3. **ParserDDL.java**: While showing up in the co-change results with a relatively high confidence level (0.25), there were no direct coupling dependencies found between `SchemaManager.java` and `ParserDDL.java`. However, due to their co-change history, it might still be prudent to review this file when changes occur in `SchemaManager.java`.\n\n4.

They appear less frequently and thus are considered lower in the likelihood of needing synchronized modifications compared to the first three entities. These should be reviewed contextually, but they do not show significant evidence of dependency through our provided tools.\n\nThe elements in the Change set are sorted in descending order of the likelihood of synchronized modifications based on the combination of co-change frequency, confidence levels, and evidence of direct coupling dependencies.

There are multiple instances where `SchemaManager.java` interacts with member variables and methods of `Database.java`. Therefore, any changes in `SchemaManager.java` could likely affect `Database.java`, making it a high-priority candidate for synchronized modifications.\n\n2. **QuerySpecification.java**: Although not directly interacting via method calls or coupling dependencies, this entity was modified alongside `SchemaManager.java` once out of eight modifications. Given its co-change history, it is worth considering for synchronization, albeit at a lower priority than `Database.java`.\n\n3. **ParserDDL.java**: While showing up in the co-change results with a relatively high confidence level (0.25), there were no direct coupling dependencies found between `SchemaManager.java` and `ParserDDL.java`. However, due to their co-change history, it might still be prudent to review this file when changes occur in `SchemaManager.java`.\n\n4.

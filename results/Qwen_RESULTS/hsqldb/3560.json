Here's an explanation for each entity:\n\n1. **NumberType.java**: This entity has a direct dependency with `IntervalType.java` as indicated by static method invocations such as `NumberType.isInLongLimits`, `NumberType.scaledDecimal`, and others. Any changes to methods within `NumberType.java` could directly impact the behavior of `IntervalType.java`.\n\n2. **FunctionSQL.java**: Although there is no explicit coupling dependency provided, the high conceptual coupling (0.823) between `IntervalType.java` and `FunctionSQL.java` suggests that they share common functionality or purpose. Changes to one may require careful review or modification of the other to maintain consistency.\n\n3. **DateTimeType.java**: This entity shares the same support count and confidence level as `NumberType.java` and `FunctionSQL.java`. Given its co-change relationship with `IntervalType.java`, it is likely that `DateTimeType.java` has similar functionality or dependencies that might be affected by changes in `IntervalType.java`.\n\n4. **Tokens.java**: With two supports and a confidence level of 0.5, `Tokens.java` is another entity that frequently appears alongside `IntervalType.java` in past modifications. It may have shared code paths or related logic requiring synchronization.\n\n5. **FunctionCustom.java**: Also appearing twice with a confidence of 0.5, this entity suggests that custom functions defined here could be related to the operations performed in `IntervalType.java`. Changes in function definitions may necessitate corresponding adjustments.\n\n6. **ExpressionLogical.java**: Listed among entities with a single support and lower confidence, `ExpressionLogical.java` is included due to its potential involvement in logical expressions relevant to interval handling. Reviewing it can ensure logical integrity across related functionalities.\n\n7. **SetFunction.java**: Like `ExpressionLogical.java`, this entity has been modified once when `IntervalType.java` was changed. It represents a part of the system possibly involved in aggregate functions or set operations where intervals play a role.\n\nEach of these entities should be considered for synchronization when changes are made to `IntervalType.java` based on their co-change relationships and the nature of their interdependencies.

Here's an explanation for each entity:\n\n1. **NumberType.java**: This entity has a direct dependency with `IntervalType.java` as indicated by static method invocations such as `NumberType.isInLongLimits`, `NumberType.scaledDecimal`, and others. Any changes to methods within `NumberType.java` could directly impact the behavior of `IntervalType.java`.\n\n2. **FunctionSQL.java**: Although there is no explicit coupling dependency provided, the high conceptual coupling (0.823) between `IntervalType.java` and `FunctionSQL.java` suggests that they share common functionality or purpose. Changes to one may require careful review or modification of the other to maintain consistency.\n\n3. **DateTimeType.java**: This entity shares the same support count and confidence level as `NumberType.java` and `FunctionSQL.java`. Given its co-change relationship with `IntervalType.java`, it is likely that `DateTimeType.java` has similar functionality or dependencies that might be affected by changes in `IntervalType.java`.\n\n4. **Tokens.java**: With two supports and a confidence level of 0.5, `Tokens.java` is another entity that frequently appears alongside `IntervalType.java` in past modifications. It may have shared code paths or related logic requiring synchronization.\n\n5. **FunctionCustom.java**: Also appearing twice with a confidence of 0.5, this entity suggests that custom functions defined here could be related to the operations performed in `IntervalType.java`. Changes in function definitions may necessitate corresponding adjustments.\n\n6. **ExpressionLogical.java**: Listed among entities with a single support and lower confidence, `ExpressionLogical.java` is included due to its potential involvement in logical expressions relevant to interval handling. Reviewing it can ensure logical integrity across related functionalities.\n\n7. **SetFunction.java**: Like `ExpressionLogical.java`, this entity has been modified once when `IntervalType.java` was changed. It represents a part of the system possibly involved in aggregate functions or set operations where intervals play a role.\n\nEach of these entities should be considered for synchronization when changes are made to `IntervalType.java` based on their co-change relationships and the nature of their interdependencies.

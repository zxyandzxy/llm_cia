Any changes in the parent class (`Server`) could directly affect its child class (`WebServer`). Therefore, it is highly likely that modifications to `Server.java` will require corresponding adjustments in `WebServer.java`.\n  \n- **ServerThread**: Although the function call graph did not show direct interactions between `Server.java` and `ServerThread.java`, historical co-change data suggests a moderate likelihood of needing synchronization. However, since `ServerThread` has been removed from the project, it no longer needs to be considered for synchronization.\n  \n- **HsqlProperties**: With a support count of 2 and confidence of 0.2, there is a possibility that `HsqlProperties` has been changed alongside `Server.java` in past revisions. Given this information, it may need to be synchronized if related properties or configurations are affected by changes in `Server.java`.\n  \n- **DatabaseManagerSwing**: Similarly, with a support count of 1 and confidence of 0.1, `DatabaseManagerSwing` has appeared in version histories along with `Server.java`. While the probability is lower, it's still worth considering due to potential shared dependencies or configurations.\n  \n- **WebServerConnection**: With a support count of 4 and confidence of 0.4, `WebServerConnection` is more likely to need synchronization with `Server.java` based on historical co-changes. This connection might share common functionality or configurations with `Server.java` or `WebServer.java`.\n\nThe elements in the Change set are sorted in descending order of the likelihood of synchronized modifications. `WebServer` is at the top because of the strong coupling dependency, followed by `WebServerConnection` with significant co-change support. Entities like `HsqlProperties` and `DatabaseManagerSwing` have lower probabilities but are included due to their past co-change history. `ServerThread` was initially considered but should be disregarded as it has been removed from the project.",

Any changes in the parent class (`Server`) could directly affect its child class (`WebServer`). Therefore, it is highly likely that modifications to `Server.java` will require corresponding adjustments in `WebServer.java`.\n  \n- **ServerThread**: Although the function call graph did not show direct interactions between `Server.java` and `ServerThread.java`, historical co-change data suggests a moderate likelihood of needing synchronization. However, since `ServerThread` has been removed from the project, it no longer needs to be considered for synchronization.\n  \n- **HsqlProperties**: With a support count of 2 and confidence of 0.2, there is a possibility that `HsqlProperties` has been changed alongside `Server.java` in past revisions. Given this information, it may need to be synchronized if related properties or configurations are affected by changes in `Server.java`.\n  \n- **DatabaseManagerSwing**: Similarly, with a support count of 1 and confidence of 0.1, `DatabaseManagerSwing` has appeared in version histories along with `Server.java`. While the probability is lower, it's still worth considering due to potential shared dependencies or configurations.\n  \n- **WebServerConnection**: With a support count of 4 and confidence of 0.4, `WebServerConnection` is more likely to need synchronization with `Server.java` based on historical co-changes. This connection might share common functionality or configurations with `Server.java` or `WebServer.java`.\n\nThe elements in the Change set are sorted in descending order of the likelihood of synchronized modifications. `WebServer` is at the top because of the strong coupling dependency, followed by `WebServerConnection` with significant co-change support. Entities like `HsqlProperties` and `DatabaseManagerSwing` have lower probabilities but are included due to their past co-change history. `ServerThread` was initially considered but should be disregarded as it has been removed from the project.",

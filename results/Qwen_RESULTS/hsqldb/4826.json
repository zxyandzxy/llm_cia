Additionally, it appears in the call graph of `RowSetNavigatorData.java`, indicating direct interaction between these two entities. The conceptual coupling score of 0.851 further suggests a strong semantic relationship, making it highly likely that changes to `RowSetNavigatorData.java` will require changes to `SortAndSlice.java`.\n\n2. **QueryExpression.java**: It shares a co-change relationship with `RowSetNavigatorData.java` (support 1, confidence 1.0) and is also referenced within its call graph. With a conceptual coupling score of 0.840, this entity has a high probability of requiring synchronization whenever there are modifications to `RowSetNavigatorData.java`. The evidence from both co-changes and call interactions supports this conclusion.\n\n3. **QuerySpecification.java**: Similar to the previous two entities, `QuerySpecification.java` has been changed alongside `RowSetNavigatorData.java` (support 1, confidence 1.0). It's present in the call graph and has a conceptual coupling score of 0.846, suggesting that it is conceptually related and likely interacts closely with `RowSetNavigatorData.java`. Therefore, any change in `RowSetNavigatorData.java` would warrant a review of `QuerySpecification.java` to ensure consistency across the system.\n\nIn summary, based on the analysis using co-change relationships, call graphs, and conceptual coupling, these three entities should be considered for synchronized modifications when changes are made to `RowSetNavigatorData.java`.

Additionally, it appears in the call graph of `RowSetNavigatorData.java`, indicating direct interaction between these two entities. The conceptual coupling score of 0.851 further suggests a strong semantic relationship, making it highly likely that changes to `RowSetNavigatorData.java` will require changes to `SortAndSlice.java`.\n\n2. **QueryExpression.java**: It shares a co-change relationship with `RowSetNavigatorData.java` (support 1, confidence 1.0) and is also referenced within its call graph. With a conceptual coupling score of 0.840, this entity has a high probability of requiring synchronization whenever there are modifications to `RowSetNavigatorData.java`. The evidence from both co-changes and call interactions supports this conclusion.\n\n3. **QuerySpecification.java**: Similar to the previous two entities, `QuerySpecification.java` has been changed alongside `RowSetNavigatorData.java` (support 1, confidence 1.0). It's present in the call graph and has a conceptual coupling score of 0.846, suggesting that it is conceptually related and likely interacts closely with `RowSetNavigatorData.java`. Therefore, any change in `RowSetNavigatorData.java` would warrant a review of `QuerySpecification.java` to ensure consistency across the system.\n\nIn summary, based on the analysis using co-change relationships, call graphs, and conceptual coupling, these three entities should be considered for synchronized modifications when changes are made to `RowSetNavigatorData.java`.

In order to help solve the CIA mission, you should first understand some necessary concepts\uff1a\n(1)entity: Entities represent source code files in CIA tasks, and all the CIA tasks under study are based on the Java language, so entities are files with the .java extension.\n(2)starting entity: The starting entity is also called salient entity, and the salient entity is the root change that causes the modification of the rest of entities in a change set, while the rest of entities are the dependency modification along with the salient one.\nYou will be presented with a starting entity and tools (functions) will be provided to access the more information of the origin system. Your task is to gradually explain which entity really need to be synchronized, based on the starting entity and the information obtained through the function-call. You have 7 chances to call the function to get more information."

Furthermore, `StatementSimple.java` directly references `Error.java`, indicating that modifications to `Error.java` are likely to affect `StatementSimple.java`.\n\n2. **ErrorCode.java**: Although there are no coupling dependencies between `Error.java` and `ErrorCode.java`, `ErrorCode.java` is used by `StatementSimple.java` and was also listed as one of the entities that have been co-changed with `Error.java`. This suggests that changes in `Error.java` may necessitate updates in `ErrorCode.java` to maintain consistency.\n\n3. **ParserDDL.java**: This file has been co-changed with `StatementSimple.java` every time it was modified (confidence level of 1.0). Given the strong co-change relationship and its potential involvement in SQL statement processing, it should be considered for synchronization when modifying `Error.java`.\n\n4. **JDBCResultSetMetaData.java**: Similar to `ParserDDL.java`, this file shows a perfect co-change confidence level with `StatementSimple.java`. It might be related to handling result sets and could require adjustments if changes in `Error.java` impact how results are processed or reported.\n\n5. **StatementDML.java**: Another file with a perfect co-change confidence level with `StatementSimple.java`, suggesting that it is closely tied to data manipulation language operations within the system. As such, any changes affecting `StatementSimple.java` could also influence `StatementDML.java`.\n\nThe elements in the Change set are sorted in descending order of the likelihood of synchronized modifications based on their direct usage, conceptual coupling, and historical co-change patterns. The first two files, `StatementSimple.java` and `ErrorCode.java`, have more direct connections and higher relevance to `Error.java`, while the remaining files follow due to their strong co-change relationships with `StatementSimple.java`.",

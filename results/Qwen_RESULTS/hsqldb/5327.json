Additionally, the conceptual coupling score of approximately 0.82 indicates that these two files have significant semantic similarity. Despite the absence of direct coupling dependencies or call graph connections, their conceptual relatedness suggests that changes in `ExpressionColumn.java` could impact `DatabaseInformationFull`. Therefore, it is highly recommended to synchronize `DatabaseInformationFull` when modifying `ExpressionColumn.java`.\n\n2. **RangeVariableResolver**\n   - *Synchronization Likelihood:* Moderate\n   - *Explanation:* This entity appeared once alongside `ExpressionColumn.java` in the co-change analysis, resulting in a confidence score of 0.5. However, no direct coupling dependencies or call graph connections were found. While there is less evidence compared to `DatabaseInformationFull`, the moderate confidence score suggests that there might be some indirect relationship or architectural dependency that warrants consideration. It would be prudent to monitor changes involving `RangeVariableResolver` when working with `ExpressionColumn.java`.\n\n3. **DataFileCache**\n   - *Synchronization Likelihood:* Low\n   - *Explanation:* Similar to `RangeVariableResolver`, `DataFileCache` also showed up once in the co-change results with a confidence score of 0.5. No direct coupling dependencies or call graph connections were identified. Given the low support and lack of additional evidence indicating strong ties, the necessity to synchronize `DataFileCache` is less clear. Nonetheless, due to its appearance in the co-change data, it should not be entirely dismissed but considered for further investigation if changes are made to `ExpressionColumn.java`.\n\nIn conclusion, the elements in the Change set are sorted in descending order of the likelihood of synchronized modifications, with `DatabaseInformationFull` being the most likely candidate for synchronization due to its strong co-change relationship and high conceptual coupling with `ExpressionColumn.java`.",

Additionally, the conceptual coupling score of approximately 0.82 indicates that these two files have significant semantic similarity. Despite the absence of direct coupling dependencies or call graph connections, their conceptual relatedness suggests that changes in `ExpressionColumn.java` could impact `DatabaseInformationFull`. Therefore, it is highly recommended to synchronize `DatabaseInformationFull` when modifying `ExpressionColumn.java`.\n\n2. **RangeVariableResolver**\n   - *Synchronization Likelihood:* Moderate\n   - *Explanation:* This entity appeared once alongside `ExpressionColumn.java` in the co-change analysis, resulting in a confidence score of 0.5. However, no direct coupling dependencies or call graph connections were found. While there is less evidence compared to `DatabaseInformationFull`, the moderate confidence score suggests that there might be some indirect relationship or architectural dependency that warrants consideration. It would be prudent to monitor changes involving `RangeVariableResolver` when working with `ExpressionColumn.java`.\n\n3. **DataFileCache**\n   - *Synchronization Likelihood:* Low\n   - *Explanation:* Similar to `RangeVariableResolver`, `DataFileCache` also showed up once in the co-change results with a confidence score of 0.5. No direct coupling dependencies or call graph connections were identified. Given the low support and lack of additional evidence indicating strong ties, the necessity to synchronize `DataFileCache` is less clear. Nonetheless, due to its appearance in the co-change data, it should not be entirely dismissed but considered for further investigation if changes are made to `ExpressionColumn.java`.\n\nIn conclusion, the elements in the Change set are sorted in descending order of the likelihood of synchronized modifications, with `DatabaseInformationFull` being the most likely candidate for synchronization due to its strong co-change relationship and high conceptual coupling with `ExpressionColumn.java`.",

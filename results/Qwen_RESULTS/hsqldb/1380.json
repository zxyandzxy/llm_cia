Even though there are no direct code-level dependencies, changes to `HsqlHeap.java` may require corresponding adjustments in `Log.java` due to their shared context or functionality.\n\n2. **DatabaseCommandInterpreter**: Co-changed with `HsqlHeap.java` and potentially related through broader system requirements or indirect dependencies. Although not directly coupled, it might need synchronization due to similar reasons as `Log`.\n\n3. **HsqlMasterRepository**: Co-changed with `HsqlHeap.java`. It could be indirectly connected through other components or higher-level system interactions that necessitate coordinated changes.\n\n4. **HsqlArrayHeap**: Another co-changed entity with possible indirect connections or relevance to the same feature set or subsystem within `hsqldb`.\n\n5. **CompiledStatement**: Co-changed with `HsqlHeap.java`, likely involved in query processing or statement handling where changes in one might affect the other.\n\n6. **Select**: Similar reasoning applies; it's part of SQL query execution mechanisms and might be affected by changes in heap management or vice versa.\n\n7. **TableFilter**: Co-changed with `HsqlHeap.java` and possibly relevant to data filtering operations that interact with the heap structure.\n\n8. **Parser**: Co-changed with `HsqlHeap.java` and potentially linked through SQL parsing and query optimization processes.\n\n9. **HsqlTimer**: Co-changed with `HsqlHeap.java` and might be related to time-based operations or scheduling that interacts with heap data structures.\n\n10. **LockFile**: Co-changed with `HsqlHeap.java` and potentially relevant to file locking mechanisms needed for concurrent access control to heap files.\n\n11. **Logger**: Co-changed with `HsqlHeap.java` and possibly related to logging functionalities that track heap operations or issues.\n\n12. **LogSyncRunner**: Co-changed with `HsqlHeap.java` and might be associated with log synchronization tasks that depend on the state of heap data.\n\n13. **NIOLockFile**: Co-changed with `HsqlHeap.java` and possibly related to non-blocking I/O lock file operations necessary for managing heap files.\n\n14. **ThreadFactory**: Co-changed with `HsqlHeap.java` but showed no coupling dependencies. Its inclusion is based on co-change patterns suggesting potential coordination needs.\n\n15. **Database**: Co-changed with `HsqlHeap.java` but showed no coupling dependencies. It is included at the bottom of the list due to its high-level interaction with the database system, which might still warrant consideration for synchronized changes under certain circumstances.\n\nEach of these entities has been identified as having some form of historical co-change relationship with `HsqlHeap.java`.

Even though there are no direct code-level dependencies, changes to `HsqlHeap.java` may require corresponding adjustments in `Log.java` due to their shared context or functionality.\n\n2. **DatabaseCommandInterpreter**: Co-changed with `HsqlHeap.java` and potentially related through broader system requirements or indirect dependencies. Although not directly coupled, it might need synchronization due to similar reasons as `Log`.\n\n3. **HsqlMasterRepository**: Co-changed with `HsqlHeap.java`. It could be indirectly connected through other components or higher-level system interactions that necessitate coordinated changes.\n\n4. **HsqlArrayHeap**: Another co-changed entity with possible indirect connections or relevance to the same feature set or subsystem within `hsqldb`.\n\n5. **CompiledStatement**: Co-changed with `HsqlHeap.java`, likely involved in query processing or statement handling where changes in one might affect the other.\n\n6. **Select**: Similar reasoning applies; it's part of SQL query execution mechanisms and might be affected by changes in heap management or vice versa.\n\n7. **TableFilter**: Co-changed with `HsqlHeap.java` and possibly relevant to data filtering operations that interact with the heap structure.\n\n8. **Parser**: Co-changed with `HsqlHeap.java` and potentially linked through SQL parsing and query optimization processes.\n\n9. **HsqlTimer**: Co-changed with `HsqlHeap.java` and might be related to time-based operations or scheduling that interacts with heap data structures.\n\n10. **LockFile**: Co-changed with `HsqlHeap.java` and potentially relevant to file locking mechanisms needed for concurrent access control to heap files.\n\n11. **Logger**: Co-changed with `HsqlHeap.java` and possibly related to logging functionalities that track heap operations or issues.\n\n12. **LogSyncRunner**: Co-changed with `HsqlHeap.java` and might be associated with log synchronization tasks that depend on the state of heap data.\n\n13. **NIOLockFile**: Co-changed with `HsqlHeap.java` and possibly related to non-blocking I/O lock file operations necessary for managing heap files.\n\n14. **ThreadFactory**: Co-changed with `HsqlHeap.java` but showed no coupling dependencies. Its inclusion is based on co-change patterns suggesting potential coordination needs.\n\n15. **Database**: Co-changed with `HsqlHeap.java` but showed no coupling dependencies. It is included at the bottom of the list due to its high-level interaction with the database system, which might still warrant consideration for synchronized changes under certain circumstances.\n\nEach of these entities has been identified as having some form of historical co-change relationship with `HsqlHeap.java`.

In order to help solve the CIA mission, you should first understand some necessary concepts\uff1a\n(1)entity: Entities represent source code files in CIA tasks, and all the CIA tasks under study are based on the Java language, so entities are files with the .java extension.\n(2)starting entity: The starting entity is also called salient entity, and the salient entity is the root change that causes the modification of the rest of entities in a change set, while the rest of entities are the dependency modification along with the salient one.\nYou will be presented with a starting entity and tools (functions) will be provided to access the more information of the origin system. Your task is to gradually explain which entity really need to be synchronized, based on the starting entity and the information obtained through the function-call.

Additionally, keeping an eye on `ParserDDL.java` and other entities with lower support/confidence values might be beneficial, but the primary focus should be on `ParserRoutine.java` and `SchemaManager.java`.",

Additionally, it is tightly coupled with `Routine.java`, as seen from the coupling dependencies, where instances of `ParserRoutine` are created and used directly within methods like `compile`. The conceptual coupling between them is also very high (0.823), indicating a strong semantic relationship.\n\n2. **SchemaManager**: It has a support value of 3 and a confidence of 0.273. The conceptual coupling with `Routine.java` is even higher than that of `ParserRoutine`, at 0.833, which suggests a significant overlap in functionality or purpose. Changes to `Routine.java` are likely to impact `SchemaManager` due to their close association.\n\n3. **ParserDDL**: With a support of 4 and a confidence of 0.364, this entity shows a relatively high chance of needing synchronization when changes occur to `Routine.java`. Although there's no direct information about its coupling with `Routine.java`, the frequent co-changes indicate a potential indirect dependency.\n\n4. **ErrorCode**: It appears in the call graph for `Routine.java`, showing a direct interaction. It also has a support of 2 and a confidence of 0.182, suggesting that it should be considered for synchronized changes due to its direct usage within `Routine.java`.\n\n5. **FunctionSQLInvoked, Token, ParserDQL, StatementSchema, UserManager, StatementCommand**: These entities have lower supports and confidences but still appear in the co-change list. They may require updates if they interact closely with the functionalities altered in `Routine.java`. While their exact relationships with `Routine.java` were not deeply explored, their appearance in the co-change history implies some level of dependency.\n\nIn conclusion, when modifying `Routine.java`, priority should be given to synchronizing changes with `ParserRoutine` and `SchemaManager`, followed by consideration for `ParserDDL` and other listed entities depending on the nature and extent of the changes being made.",

Additionally, keeping an eye on `ParserDDL.java` and other entities with lower support/confidence values might be beneficial, but the primary focus should be on `ParserRoutine.java` and `SchemaManager.java`.",

Additionally, it is tightly coupled with `Routine.java`, as seen from the coupling dependencies, where instances of `ParserRoutine` are created and used directly within methods like `compile`. The conceptual coupling between them is also very high (0.823), indicating a strong semantic relationship.\n\n2. **SchemaManager**: It has a support value of 3 and a confidence of 0.273. The conceptual coupling with `Routine.java` is even higher than that of `ParserRoutine`, at 0.833, which suggests a significant overlap in functionality or purpose. Changes to `Routine.java` are likely to impact `SchemaManager` due to their close association.\n\n3. **ParserDDL**: With a support of 4 and a confidence of 0.364, this entity shows a relatively high chance of needing synchronization when changes occur to `Routine.java`. Although there's no direct information about its coupling with `Routine.java`, the frequent co-changes indicate a potential indirect dependency.\n\n4. **ErrorCode**: It appears in the call graph for `Routine.java`, showing a direct interaction. It also has a support of 2 and a confidence of 0.182, suggesting that it should be considered for synchronized changes due to its direct usage within `Routine.java`.\n\n5. **FunctionSQLInvoked, Token, ParserDQL, StatementSchema, UserManager, StatementCommand**: These entities have lower supports and confidences but still appear in the co-change list. They may require updates if they interact closely with the functionalities altered in `Routine.java`. While their exact relationships with `Routine.java` were not deeply explored, their appearance in the co-change history implies some level of dependency.\n\nIn conclusion, when modifying `Routine.java`, priority should be given to synchronizing changes with `ParserRoutine` and `SchemaManager`, followed by consideration for `ParserDDL` and other listed entities depending on the nature and extent of the changes being made.",

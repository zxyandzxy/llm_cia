The high probability suggests a strong relationship in terms of past changes.\n  \n- **Result.java**: Although it only appeared once in the co-change history with a confidence of 0.25, `Result` is directly called by `Error.java`, and the conceptual coupling score is very high (0.83), suggesting a semantically close relationship. Therefore, any modifications to `Error.java` are likely to require corresponding changes in `Result.java`.\n  \n- **BundleHandler.java**: Similar to `Result.java`, `BundleHandler` is also directly called by `Error.java` and has a high conceptual coupling score (0.84).

The high probability suggests a strong relationship in terms of past changes.\n  \n- **Result.java**: Although it only appeared once in the co-change history with a confidence of 0.25, `Result` is directly called by `Error.java`, and the conceptual coupling score is very high (0.83), suggesting a semantically close relationship. Therefore, any modifications to `Error.java` are likely to require corresponding changes in `Result.java`.\n  \n- **BundleHandler.java**: Similar to `Result.java`, `BundleHandler` is also directly called by `Error.java` and has a high conceptual coupling score (0.84). It's important for synchronization due to its semantic relation and direct usage within `Error.java`.\n  \n- **StringUtil.java**: With the highest conceptual coupling score (0.85) among the three entities called by `Error.java`, `StringUtil` is tightly related to `Error.java` semantically. Thus, changes in `Error.java` should prompt a review of `StringUtil.java` as well.\n\nThe remaining entities ([Types.java, ErrorCode.java, ..., SimpleStore.java]) have been included based on their appearance in the co-change analysis results. They all have low support counts and confidence levels (0.25), which makes their relationship less certain. However, since they were changed at least once along with `Error.java` in the past, they might still need to be reviewed for potential changes, albeit with lower priority compared to the top four entities.

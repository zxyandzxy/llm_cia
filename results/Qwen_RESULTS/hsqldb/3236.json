Other entities identified may also need to be reviewed, but they do not exhibit such strong evidence for necessary synchronization as `NodeAVLDisk.java`. \n\nTherefore, our primary recommendation for change impact analysis is to focus on `NodeAVLDisk.java` when making changes to `NodeAVL.java`.",

Other entities identified may also need to be reviewed, but they do not exhibit such strong evidence for necessary synchronization as `NodeAVLDisk.java`. \n\nTherefore, our primary recommendation for change impact analysis is to focus on `NodeAVLDisk.java` when making changes to `NodeAVL.java`.",

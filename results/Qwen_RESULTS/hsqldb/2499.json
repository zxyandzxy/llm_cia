Therefore, changes to `Row.java` could indeed imply necessary changes in `RowAction.java`, given their conceptual closeness.\n\nConsidering this information, we should recommend including `RowAction.java` for synchronization when `Row.java` is changed.

However, since they are directly used by `Row.java`, any significant changes to `Row.java` could still necessitate changes in these files due to direct functional dependencies.\n\nAmong these, we should consider if there's a need to further analyze any of these entities based on their roles and how tightly they are coupled with `Row.java`.

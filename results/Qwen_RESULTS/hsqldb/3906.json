Additionally, the conceptual coupling between them is high at approximately 0.854, indicating that they are semantically related and likely share common functionality or requirements. Therefore, it is highly recommended to synchronize changes with `ParserCommand`.\n\n2. **StatementTypes**: Although this entity has a weaker co-change relationship with `StatementCommand.java`, having been changed only 1 time out of 3 with a confidence of about 0.33, it still appears in the co-change history. It suggests that there might be some shared functionality or dependencies, even though no direct code-level relationships were found.\n\n3. **SchemaManager**: Similar to `StatementTypes`, `SchemaManager` also has a weaker co-change relationship with `StatementCommand.java`, appearing in the modification history 1 time out of 3 with a confidence of about 0.33. The lack of direct coupling or call graph connections does not completely rule out the possibility of needing synchronization, especially if changes affect shared data structures or database schemas.\n\n4. **ParserDDL**: Like `StatementTypes` and `SchemaManager`, `ParserDDL` has appeared in the co-change history 1 time out of 3 with a confidence of about 0.33. While it may have less apparent reasons for requiring synchronization compared to the entities above, its presence in the co-change pattern suggests potential indirect relationships that could necessitate review during changes.\n\nIn summary, while `ParserCommand` should be prioritized for synchronized changes due to its strong co-change relationship and semantic similarity with `StatementCommand.java`, other entities such as `StatementTypes`, `SchemaManager`, and `ParserDDL` should also be considered based on the specific nature of the changes being made. If the changes involve updates to shared features or functionalities, these entities may need to be updated as well.",

Moreover, when checking for coupling dependencies between `StatementCommand.java` and `ParserCommand`, we found no direct coupling dependencies.\n\nGiven this information, we can conclude that although `ParserCommand` has a strong co-change relationship with `StatementCommand.java`, there are no direct coupling or call relationships evident in the code structure. This implies that their relationship may be driven by higher-level changes in the system, possibly due to common requirements or feature updates affecting both files.\n\nNext, I will check if there's any conceptual coupling between `StatementCommand.java` and `ParserCommand` using the `get_conceptual_coupling` function.

Additionally, the conceptual coupling between them is high at approximately 0.854, indicating that they are semantically related and likely share common functionality or requirements. Therefore, it is highly recommended to synchronize changes with `ParserCommand`.\n\n2. **StatementTypes**: Although this entity has a weaker co-change relationship with `StatementCommand.java`, having been changed only 1 time out of 3 with a confidence of about 0.33, it still appears in the co-change history. It suggests that there might be some shared functionality or dependencies, even though no direct code-level relationships were found.\n\n3. **SchemaManager**: Similar to `StatementTypes`, `SchemaManager` also has a weaker co-change relationship with `StatementCommand.java`, appearing in the modification history 1 time out of 3 with a confidence of about 0.33. The lack of direct coupling or call graph connections does not completely rule out the possibility of needing synchronization, especially if changes affect shared data structures or database schemas.\n\n4. **ParserDDL**: Like `StatementTypes` and `SchemaManager`, `ParserDDL` has appeared in the co-change history 1 time out of 3 with a confidence of about 0.33. While it may have less apparent reasons for requiring synchronization compared to the entities above, its presence in the co-change pattern suggests potential indirect relationships that could necessitate review during changes.\n\nIn summary, while `ParserCommand` should be prioritized for synchronized changes due to its strong co-change relationship and semantic similarity with `StatementCommand.java`, other entities such as `StatementTypes`, `SchemaManager`, and `ParserDDL` should also be considered based on the specific nature of the changes being made. If the changes involve updates to shared features or functionalities, these entities may need to be updated as well.",

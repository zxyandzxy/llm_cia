Like the previous entities, it indicates that it could require modifications alongside `TransactionManager.java` due to their shared conceptual basis.\n\n5. **IndexAVL.java**: This entity has been changed along with `TransactionManager.java` three times, giving it a confidence level of 0.375. While its conceptual relationship was not evaluated, the co-change pattern suggests some dependency, though less significant than the top four entities.\n\n6. **RowAction.java**: Also showing up three times in co-changes with `TransactionManager.java`, this entity has a confidence level of 0.375. Its necessity for synchronization seems to be moderate based on historical data.\n\n7. **DataFileCache.java**: With two co-changes, this entity has a confidence level of 0.25.

Your task is to gradually explain which entity really need to be synchronized, based on the starting entity and the information obtained through the function-call. You have 7 chances to call the function to get more information."

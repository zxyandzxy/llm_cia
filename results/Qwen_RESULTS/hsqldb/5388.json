Your task is to gradually explain which entity really need to be synchronized, based on the starting entity and the information obtained through the function-call.

Even though there are no coupling dependencies found, it is directly invoked or referenced by `TableDerived.java`. This indicates that changes in `TableDerived.java` might impact `HashMappedList`, making it necessary to synchronize these two entities.\n\n2. **Type**: With a conceptual coupling probability of 0.851, which is even higher than that of `HashMappedList`, `Type` is also considered important for synchronization. It is directly used by `TableDerived.java`, suggesting that modifications in `TableDerived.java` could have implications for `Type`.\n\n3. **ArrayUtil**: While we don't have specific details about its conceptual coupling or direct dependencies, `ArrayUtil` is called or referenced by `TableDerived.java`. Thus, any changes in `TableDerived.java` that involve functionality related to `ArrayUtil` would require corresponding updates in `ArrayUtil`.\n\n4. **Error**: Similar to `ArrayUtil`, `Error` is directly invoked or referenced by `TableDerived.java`. It's essential to ensure that error-handling mechanisms remain consistent across both files, necessitating synchronized changes when relevant parts of `TableDerived.java` are modified.\n\n5. **ErrorCode**: As part of the error-handling mechanism and directly referenced by `TableDerived.java`, `ErrorCode` should be synchronized with changes in `TableDerived.java`. This ensures that any new error codes introduced or existing ones modified in `TableDerived.java` are reflected appropriately in `ErrorCode`.\n\n6. **ValuePool**: Although not much detail is provided about its relationship with `TableDerived.java`, since it is directly invoked or referenced, it must be included in the change set. Changes affecting data storage or retrieval mechanisms in `TableDerived.java` may require updates to `ValuePool` as well.\n\nIn summary, the above change set prioritizes entities based on their conceptual coupling with `TableDerived.java` and their direct interactions through calls or references. Synchronizing these entities with changes made to `TableDerived.java` will help maintain consistency and avoid potential issues arising from ripple effects caused by code modifications.",

Even though there are no coupling dependencies found, it is directly invoked or referenced by `TableDerived.java`. This indicates that changes in `TableDerived.java` might impact `HashMappedList`, making it necessary to synchronize these two entities.\n\n2. **Type**: With a conceptual coupling probability of 0.851, which is even higher than that of `HashMappedList`, `Type` is also considered important for synchronization. It is directly used by `TableDerived.java`, suggesting that modifications in `TableDerived.java` could have implications for `Type`.\n\n3. **ArrayUtil**: While we don't have specific details about its conceptual coupling or direct dependencies, `ArrayUtil` is called or referenced by `TableDerived.java`. Thus, any changes in `TableDerived.java` that involve functionality related to `ArrayUtil` would require corresponding updates in `ArrayUtil`.\n\n4. **Error**: Similar to `ArrayUtil`, `Error` is directly invoked or referenced by `TableDerived.java`. It's essential to ensure that error-handling mechanisms remain consistent across both files, necessitating synchronized changes when relevant parts of `TableDerived.java` are modified.\n\n5. **ErrorCode**: As part of the error-handling mechanism and directly referenced by `TableDerived.java`, `ErrorCode` should be synchronized with changes in `TableDerived.java`. This ensures that any new error codes introduced or existing ones modified in `TableDerived.java` are reflected appropriately in `ErrorCode`.\n\n6. **ValuePool**: Although not much detail is provided about its relationship with `TableDerived.java`, since it is directly invoked or referenced, it must be included in the change set. Changes affecting data storage or retrieval mechanisms in `TableDerived.java` may require updates to `ValuePool` as well.\n\nIn summary, the above change set prioritizes entities based on their conceptual coupling with `TableDerived.java` and their direct interactions through calls or references. Synchronizing these entities with changes made to `TableDerived.java` will help maintain consistency and avoid potential issues arising from ripple effects caused by code modifications.",

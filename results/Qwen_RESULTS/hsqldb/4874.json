In order to help solve the CIA mission, you should first understand some necessary concepts\uff1a\n(1)entity: Entities represent source code files in CIA tasks, and all the CIA tasks under study are based on the Java language, so entities are files with the .java extension.\n(2)starting entity: The starting entity is also called salient entity, and the salient entity is the root change that causes the modification of the rest of entities in a change set, while the rest of entities are the dependency modification along with the salient one.\nYou will be presented with a starting entity and tools (functions) will be provided to access the more information of the origin system. Your task is to gradually explain which entity really need to be synchronized, based on the starting entity and the information obtained through the function-call. You have 7 chances to call the function to get more information."

It also has a high conceptual coupling probability of 0.756, indicating a strong semantic relationship that suggests these two files should be synchronized when changes occur.\n\n2. **TransactionManagerCommon.java**: Similarly to `TransactionManagerMV2PL.java`, this file has been co-changed with `TransactionManager.java` 5 times out of 8 (Supports: 5, Confidence: 0.625) and has an even higher conceptual coupling probability of 0.877.

Although there is no direct coupling dependency, its co-change frequency suggests a potential indirect relationship or shared functionality that might require synchronization.\n\n4. **RowAction.java**: Also co-changed 3 times (Supports: 3, Confidence: 0.375), this entity may need to be considered for synchronization due to its frequent appearance alongside changes to `TransactionManager.java`.\n\n5. **Session.java**: Appeared in 2 out of 8 changes (Supports: 2, Confidence: 0.25), which is less than the previous entities but still notable enough to warrant attention for possible synchronization.\n\n6. **TransactionManager2PL.java**: While this entity has a high confidence score (Supports: 6, Confidence: 0.75), it shares no coupling dependencies with `TransactionManager.java`. However, given the historical pattern of co-changes, it should not be completely disregarded and could benefit from a review for potential impacts.\n\n7. **DataFileCache.java**: Appeared in 2 out of 8 changes (Supports: 2, Confidence: 0.25). Its co-change history indicates some level of association that merits consideration for synchronization.\n\n8. **ParserRoutine.java**: Co-changed once with `TransactionManager.java` (Supports: 1, Confidence: 0.125). The lower support and confidence suggest a weaker connection, but it's included due to its presence in the co-change data.\n\n9. **ErrorCode.java**: With only one co-change (Supports: 1, Confidence: 0.125), it has a low likelihood of requiring synchronization, but its inclusion is based on the existing co-change record.\n\n10. **LobManager.java**: Like `ErrorCode.java`, it was co-changed once (Supports: 1, Confidence: 0.125). It is listed last in the change set as it has the lowest confidence among the identified entities.\n\nEach of the above entities either has a history of being changed together with `TransactionManager.java` or shares a conceptual relationship that implies a functional interdependence.

Although there is no direct coupling dependency, its co-change frequency suggests a potential indirect relationship or shared functionality that might require synchronization.\n\n4. **RowAction.java**: Also co-changed 3 times (Supports: 3, Confidence: 0.375), this entity may need to be considered for synchronization due to its frequent appearance alongside changes to `TransactionManager.java`.\n\n5. **Session.java**: Appeared in 2 out of 8 changes (Supports: 2, Confidence: 0.25), which is less than the previous entities but still notable enough to warrant attention for possible synchronization.\n\n6. **TransactionManager2PL.java**: While this entity has a high confidence score (Supports: 6, Confidence: 0.75), it shares no coupling dependencies with `TransactionManager.java`. However, given the historical pattern of co-changes, it should not be completely disregarded and could benefit from a review for potential impacts.\n\n7. **DataFileCache.java**: Appeared in 2 out of 8 changes (Supports: 2, Confidence: 0.25). Its co-change history indicates some level of association that merits consideration for synchronization.\n\n8. **ParserRoutine.java**: Co-changed once with `TransactionManager.java` (Supports: 1, Confidence: 0.125). The lower support and confidence suggest a weaker connection, but it's included due to its presence in the co-change data.\n\n9. **ErrorCode.java**: With only one co-change (Supports: 1, Confidence: 0.125), it has a low likelihood of requiring synchronization, but its inclusion is based on the existing co-change record.\n\n10. **LobManager.java**: Like `ErrorCode.java`, it was co-changed once (Supports: 1, Confidence: 0.125). It is listed last in the change set as it has the lowest confidence among the identified entities.\n\nEach of the above entities either has a history of being changed together with `TransactionManager.java` or shares a conceptual relationship that implies a functional interdependence.

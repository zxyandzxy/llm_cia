Changes in the parent class can directly affect its subclasses. Therefore, any changes to `DataFileCache.java` might necessitate corresponding changes in `TextCache`.\n\n2. **DataFileCacheSession**: DataFileCacheSession also extends DataFileCache (Inheritance). Similar to TextCache, since it inherits from `DataFileCache.java`, changes in the base class may require changes in this subclass.\n\n3. **DataFileDefrag**: There is a direct method invocation and variable usage between `DataFileCache.java` and `DataFileDefrag`. The methods in `DataFileCache.java` create instances of `DataFileDefrag` and call its member methods. This indicates that changes in `DataFileCache.java` could impact `DataFileDefrag`, making it necessary to synchronize these files.\n\n4. **DatabaseInformationFull**: This entity has appeared alongside `DataFileCache.java` during 4 out of 17 changes with a confidence level of 0.235. Although we don't have detailed coupling information, the high support and confidence suggest a significant co-change relationship, warranting consideration for synchronization.\n\n5. **RowAction**: With 3 supports and a confidence level of 0.176, `RowAction` appears to be frequently changed along with `DataFileCache.java`. Further investigation would be needed to determine the exact nature of their dependency, but given the confidence, it should be included in the change set.\n\n6. **Logger**: Similarly, `Logger` has been modified together with `DataFileCache.java` 3 times, with a confidence level of 0.176. It's likely used for logging purposes within `DataFileCache.java` or related operations, so changes in `DataFileCache.java` might influence logging behavior.\n\n7. **Log**: Also appearing 3 times with the same confidence as `Logger`, `Log` is included due to its frequent co-changes with `DataFileCache.java`. It may share similar functionality or dependencies with `Logger`, thus requiring synchronization.\n\nEach entity in the change set needs to be considered for synchronization because they either inherit from `DataFileCache.java`, directly interact with it through method calls, or have shown a pattern of being changed together based on historical data. Understanding and addressing the potential ripple effects on these entities will help maintain consistency and integrity across the codebase when modifying `DataFileCache.java`.",

Changes in the parent class can directly affect its subclasses. Therefore, any changes to `DataFileCache.java` might necessitate corresponding changes in `TextCache`.\n\n2. **DataFileCacheSession**: DataFileCacheSession also extends DataFileCache (Inheritance). Similar to TextCache, since it inherits from `DataFileCache.java`, changes in the base class may require changes in this subclass.\n\n3. **DataFileDefrag**: There is a direct method invocation and variable usage between `DataFileCache.java` and `DataFileDefrag`. The methods in `DataFileCache.java` create instances of `DataFileDefrag` and call its member methods. This indicates that changes in `DataFileCache.java` could impact `DataFileDefrag`, making it necessary to synchronize these files.\n\n4. **DatabaseInformationFull**: This entity has appeared alongside `DataFileCache.java` during 4 out of 17 changes with a confidence level of 0.235. Although we don't have detailed coupling information, the high support and confidence suggest a significant co-change relationship, warranting consideration for synchronization.\n\n5. **RowAction**: With 3 supports and a confidence level of 0.176, `RowAction` appears to be frequently changed along with `DataFileCache.java`. Further investigation would be needed to determine the exact nature of their dependency, but given the confidence, it should be included in the change set.\n\n6. **Logger**: Similarly, `Logger` has been modified together with `DataFileCache.java` 3 times, with a confidence level of 0.176. It's likely used for logging purposes within `DataFileCache.java` or related operations, so changes in `DataFileCache.java` might influence logging behavior.\n\n7. **Log**: Also appearing 3 times with the same confidence as `Logger`, `Log` is included due to its frequent co-changes with `DataFileCache.java`. It may share similar functionality or dependencies with `Logger`, thus requiring synchronization.\n\nEach entity in the change set needs to be considered for synchronization because they either inherit from `DataFileCache.java`, directly interact with it through method calls, or have shown a pattern of being changed together based on historical data.

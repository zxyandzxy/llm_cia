In order to help solve the CIA mission, you should first understand some necessary concepts\uff1a\n(1)entity: Entities represent source code files in CIA tasks, and all the CIA tasks under study are based on the Java language, so entities are files with the .java extension.\n(2)starting entity: The starting entity is also called salient entity, and the salient entity is the root change that causes the modification of the rest of entities in a change set, while the rest of entities are the dependency modification along with the salient one.\nYou will be presented with a starting entity and tools (functions) will be provided to access the more information of the origin system. Your task is to gradually explain which entity really need to be synchronized, based on the starting entity and the information obtained through the function-call. You have 7 chances to call the function to get more information."

Additionally, it shares a high semantic similarity probability with `NumberType.java`, suggesting shared functionality or concepts.\n\n2. **FunctionCustom.java**: Similar to `FunctionSQL.java`, it also has a high support count (3) and confidence (0.6). The conceptual coupling between `NumberType.java` and `FunctionCustom.java` is even slightly higher than that with `FunctionSQL.java`, reinforcing the need for synchronization during changes.\n\n3. **Type.java**: With a support count of 2 and confidence of 0.4, this entity has been co-changed more frequently than most others listed. Although there's no direct coupling dependency identified, its frequent co-modification history with `NumberType.java` makes it a candidate for synchronization.\n\n4. **ExpressionLogical.java**: This entity also has a support count of 2 and confidence of 0.4, similar to `Type.java`. While there's no direct evidence of code interdependencies, its historical co-changes suggest it might be affected by modifications in `NumberType.java`.\n\n5. **RangeVariable.java**: This entity appears once in the co-change history with `NumberType.java` and has a confidence of 0.2. Given its lower confidence, it is less likely to require synchronization but should still be considered due to past co-changes.\n\n6. **QuerySpecification.java**: Similar to `RangeVariable.java`, it has a support count of 1 and a confidence level of 0.2. It should be included in the change set but prioritized after entities with higher support counts and confidences.\n\n7. **IntervalType.java** & **DateTimeType.java**: Both have a support count of 1 and a confidence of 0.2.

They are included last in the change set as they are the least likely to require synchronization based on the given data but should still be monitored for potential impacts.\n\nIn conclusion, while the top two candidates (`FunctionSQL.java` and `FunctionCustom.java`) show strong evidence of needing synchronization with `NumberType.java`, other entities should not be entirely dismissed but rather considered based on the context of the specific changes being made to `NumberType.java`.",

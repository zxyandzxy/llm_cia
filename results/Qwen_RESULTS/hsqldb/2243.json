In order to help solve the CIA mission, you should first understand some necessary concepts\uff1a\n(1)entity: Entities represent source code files in CIA tasks, and all the CIA tasks under study are based on the Java language, so entities are files with the .java extension.\n(2)starting entity: The starting entity is also called salient entity, and the salient entity is the root change that causes the modification of the rest of entities in a change set, while the rest of entities are the dependency modification along with the salient one.\nYou will be presented with a starting entity and tools (functions) will be provided to access the more information of the origin system. Your task is to gradually explain which entity really need to be synchronized, based on the starting entity and the information obtained through the function-call. You have 7 chances to call the function to get more information."

Moreover, there's a strong conceptual similarity between these two entities, suggesting that they are closely related in functionality and changes to one may require changes to the other.\n\n2. **Select**: This entity has a support count of 10 and confidence of approximately 16.9%. It also shares a very high conceptual similarity probability with `Expression.java`, indicating that both files are conceptually aligned and often modified together.\n\n3. **DatabaseCommandInterpreter**: This entity appears in the co-change list with a support count of 9 and confidence of about 15.3%. While we don't have detailed coupling or call graph information, it frequently co-changes with `Expression.java`, suggesting a functional relationship.\n\n4. **Session**: With a support count of 8 and confidence of approximately 13.6%, this entity is likely to be affected by changes to `Expression.java`. The frequency of co-changes implies that it might interact with expressions within the session context.\n\n5. **TableFilter**: Having a support count of 6 and confidence of around 10.2%, this entity should be considered for synchronized changes due to its frequent modification alongside `Expression.java`.\n\n6. **CompiledStatement**: Also with a support count of 6 and confidence of about 10.2%, this entity seems to be involved in similar feature changes as `Expression.java`.\n\n7. **Function**: With a support count of 7 and confidence of approximately 11.9%, this entity is another candidate for synchronized changes. Its co-change history with `Expression.java` suggests shared logic or dependencies.\n\n8. **QueryExpression**: With a support count of 3 and confidence of about 5.1%, this entity shows up less frequently but still has a notable co-change relationship with `Expression.java`.\n\n9. **ExpressionLogical**: This entity has a support count of 8 and confidence of approximately 13.6%, which indicates a significant likelihood of needing synchronized changes when `Expression.java` is modified.\n\n10. **ExpressionAggregate**: With a support count of 5 and confidence of about 8.5%, this entity is included because of its frequent co-change occurrences with `Expression.java`, implying that aggregate expressions may need updates along with `Expression.java`.\n\nThe elements in the Change set are sorted in descending order of the likelihood of synchronized modifications based on the support count and confidence level from the co-change analysis, supplemented by the conceptual coupling where applicable.

While we don't have detailed coupling or call graph information, it frequently co-changes with `Expression.java`, suggesting a functional relationship.\n\n4. **Session**: With a support count of 8 and confidence of approximately 13.6%, this entity is likely to be affected by changes to `Expression.java`. The frequency of co-changes implies that it might interact with expressions within the session context.\n\n5. **TableFilter**: Having a support count of 6 and confidence of around 10.2%, this entity should be considered for synchronized changes due to its frequent modification alongside `Expression.java`.\n\n6. **CompiledStatement**: Also with a support count of 6 and confidence of about 10.2%, this entity seems to be involved in similar feature changes as `Expression.java`.\n\n7. **Function**: With a support count of 7 and confidence of approximately 11.9%, this entity is another candidate for synchronized changes. Its co-change history with `Expression.java` suggests shared logic or dependencies.\n\n8. **QueryExpression**: With a support count of 3 and confidence of about 5.1%, this entity shows up less frequently but still has a notable co-change relationship with `Expression.java`.\n\n9. **ExpressionLogical**: This entity has a support count of 8 and confidence of approximately 13.6%, which indicates a significant likelihood of needing synchronized changes when `Expression.java` is modified.\n\n10. **ExpressionAggregate**: With a support count of 5 and confidence of about 8.5%, this entity is included because of its frequent co-change occurrences with `Expression.java`, implying that aggregate expressions may need updates along with `Expression.java`.\n\nThe elements in the Change set are sorted in descending order of the likelihood of synchronized modifications based on the support count and confidence level from the co-change analysis, supplemented by the conceptual coupling where applicable.

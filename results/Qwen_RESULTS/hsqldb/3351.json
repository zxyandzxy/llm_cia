Whenever \"ExpressionLike.java\" was modified, \"TestLikePredicateOptimizations\" was also changed (with support count 1 and confidence 1.0).

Since this return type might be affected by changes in \"HsqlList\", it's essential to synchronize any updates to ensure the correct functioning of methods returning \"HsqlList\" instances.\n\n3. **Type**: A Static Variable Invoking (SAI) coupling dependency exists where the method `resolveTypes` in \"ExpressionLike.java\" invokes static variables from \"Type\". Changes to these static variables or their usage can impact the behavior of \"ExpressionLike.java\", making it necessary to consider \"Type\" for synchronization when modifying \"ExpressionLike.java\".\n\n4. **BinaryData**: The analysis found a Type Casting (TC) coupling dependency where \"BinaryData\" is used as part of a type casting operation in \"ExpressionLike.java\".

Since this return type might be affected by changes in \"HsqlList\", it's essential to synchronize any updates to ensure the correct functioning of methods returning \"HsqlList\" instances.\n\n3. **Type**: A Static Variable Invoking (SAI) coupling dependency exists where the method `resolveTypes` in \"ExpressionLike.java\" invokes static variables from \"Type\".

Your task is to gradually explain which entity really need to be synchronized, based on the starting entity and the information obtained through the function-call.

Changes to methods or variables within `NumberType.java` could directly impact the functionality in `IntervalType.java`, making it crucial to synchronize these two files.\n\n2. **DateTimeType.java**:\n   - Support Count: 2\n   - Confidence: 0.5\n   - Explanation: A static method from `DateTimeType.java` (`subtractMonths`) is invoked in `IntervalType.java`. This direct interaction means that any changes affecting this method could require corresponding adjustments in `IntervalType.java`, thus necessitating synchronization.\n\n3. **Tokens.java**:\n   - Support Count: 2\n   - Confidence: 0.5\n   - Explanation: Several static variables from `Tokens.java` are used within various methods of `IntervalType.java`. Since `IntervalType.java` relies on these tokens for interval-related definitions, changes to `Tokens.java` may require updates to maintain consistency in `IntervalType.java`.\n\n4. **FunctionSQL.java**:\n   - Support Count: 2\n   - Confidence: 0.5\n   - Explanation: Despite a high support count and confidence level, there are no direct coupling dependencies found between `IntervalType.java` and `FunctionSQL.java`. However, their co-change relationship suggests potential indirect dependencies or shared use cases that might warrant careful consideration during changes but with less urgency than the entities listed above.\n\n5. **FunctionCustom.java**:\n   - Support Count: 2\n   - Confidence: 0.5\n   - Explanation: Similar to `FunctionSQL.java`, there is no evidence of direct coupling dependencies. The co-change relationship implies possible higher-level architectural reasons for their simultaneous modification, though it's less critical to synchronize compared to entities with identified direct interactions.\n\n6. **SetFunction.java**:\n   - Support Count: 1\n   - Confidence: 0.25\n   - Explanation: With a lower support count and confidence, `SetFunction.java` has appeared alongside `IntervalType.java` in version history only once. While its appearance indicates some form of historical relationship, the lower confidence suggests a reduced likelihood of needing concurrent changes. It should be monitored but not prioritized for immediate synchronization.\n\nThe provided change set includes entities that have been frequently modified together with `IntervalType.java` based on version history. Entities with stronger coupling dependencies (NumberType.java, DateTimeType.java, Tokens.java) are prioritized for synchronization due to their direct interactions, whereas those with co-change relationships but lacking direct coupling (FunctionSQL.java, FunctionCustom.java) are considered secondary.

Changes to methods or variables within `NumberType.java` could directly impact the functionality in `IntervalType.java`, making it crucial to synchronize these two files.\n\n2. **DateTimeType.java**:\n   - Support Count: 2\n   - Confidence: 0.5\n   - Explanation: A static method from `DateTimeType.java` (`subtractMonths`) is invoked in `IntervalType.java`. This direct interaction means that any changes affecting this method could require corresponding adjustments in `IntervalType.java`, thus necessitating synchronization.\n\n3. **Tokens.java**:\n   - Support Count: 2\n   - Confidence: 0.5\n   - Explanation: Several static variables from `Tokens.java` are used within various methods of `IntervalType.java`. Since `IntervalType.java` relies on these tokens for interval-related definitions, changes to `Tokens.java` may require updates to maintain consistency in `IntervalType.java`.\n\n4. **FunctionSQL.java**:\n   - Support Count: 2\n   - Confidence: 0.5\n   - Explanation: Despite a high support count and confidence level, there are no direct coupling dependencies found between `IntervalType.java` and `FunctionSQL.java`. However, their co-change relationship suggests potential indirect dependencies or shared use cases that might warrant careful consideration during changes but with less urgency than the entities listed above.\n\n5. **FunctionCustom.java**:\n   - Support Count: 2\n   - Confidence: 0.5\n   - Explanation: Similar to `FunctionSQL.java`, there is no evidence of direct coupling dependencies.

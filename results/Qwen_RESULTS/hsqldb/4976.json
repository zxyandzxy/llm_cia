Any changes made to `FunctionCustom.java` might require corresponding changes in `FunctionSQL.java`, and vice versa, due to their tight coupling.\n\nConsidering this information, `FunctionSQL.java` should be included in any synchronization efforts when making changes to `FunctionCustom.java`.\n\nHowever, we have used up our chances to call additional functions to further analyze other co-changed entities. Based on the analysis performed so far, I can conclude that among the provided co-changed entities, `FunctionSQL.java` is the one that really needs to be synchronized with `FunctionCustom.java` due to the direct and significant coupling dependencies between them.\n\nIf more calls were possible, further investigation into other co-changed entities would be beneficial to ensure no other critical dependencies are missed.

The elements in the Change set are sorted in descending order of the likelihood of synchronized modifications.\n\n1. **FunctionSQL**: This entity has a strong coupling relationship with `FunctionCustom.java` as indicated by the return type dependency and multiple instances of method member variable usage and invoking. It is highly likely that changes to `FunctionCustom.java` will require corresponding changes in `FunctionSQL.java` due to their interdependent code structures.\n\n2. **ParserDQL**: Although there were no direct coupling dependencies found between `FunctionCustom.java` and `ParserDQL.java`, they co-changed together in the past. However, given the lack of direct coupling evidence, this co-change relationship could be coincidental or related to broader project changes. Therefore, it's ranked lower than `FunctionSQL`.\n\n3. **FunctionSQLInvoked**: Similar to `ParserDQL`, this entity appears in the co-change list but we did not find any direct coupling dependencies through our function calls. Its position in the change set reflects its lower likelihood of requiring synchronized changes compared to `FunctionSQL`.\n\n4. **RoutineSchema**: Like `ParserDQL` and `FunctionSQLInvoked`, this entity was identified as part of the co-change history but does not show any direct coupling with `FunctionCustom.java`. Hence, it is placed below other entities with stronger indications of potential impact.\n\n5. **Session**: This entity also appeared in the co-change list but without any detected coupling dependencies. As such, it is considered less likely to need synchronization based on the available information.\n\n6. **ExpressionOp**: Lastly, `ExpressionOp` shares the same rationale as the previous entities mentioned. It has been changed alongside `FunctionCustom.java` before, but there is no direct coupling evidence linking them. Consequently, it is positioned at the bottom of the change set.\n\nIn summary, while all these entities have shown some level of co-change behavior historically, only `FunctionSQL` demonstrates significant technical reasons for needing synchronized changes with `FunctionCustom.java`. The remaining entities should be reviewed contextually for any indirect impacts or historical patterns that might necessitate updates.",

The elements in the Change set are sorted in descending order of the likelihood of synchronized modifications.\n\n1. **FunctionSQL**: This entity has a strong coupling relationship with `FunctionCustom.java` as indicated by the return type dependency and multiple instances of method member variable usage and invoking. It is highly likely that changes to `FunctionCustom.java` will require corresponding changes in `FunctionSQL.java` due to their interdependent code structures.\n\n2. **ParserDQL**: Although there were no direct coupling dependencies found between `FunctionCustom.java` and `ParserDQL.java`, they co-changed together in the past. However, given the lack of direct coupling evidence, this co-change relationship could be coincidental or related to broader project changes. Therefore, it's ranked lower than `FunctionSQL`.\n\n3. **FunctionSQLInvoked**: Similar to `ParserDQL`, this entity appears in the co-change list but we did not find any direct coupling dependencies through our function calls. Its position in the change set reflects its lower likelihood of requiring synchronized changes compared to `FunctionSQL`.\n\n4. **RoutineSchema**: Like `ParserDQL` and `FunctionSQLInvoked`, this entity was identified as part of the co-change history but does not show any direct coupling with `FunctionCustom.java`. Hence, it is placed below other entities with stronger indications of potential impact.\n\n5. **Session**: This entity also appeared in the co-change list but without any detected coupling dependencies. As such, it is considered less likely to need synchronization based on the available information.\n\n6. **ExpressionOp**: Lastly, `ExpressionOp` shares the same rationale as the previous entities mentioned. It has been changed alongside `FunctionCustom.java` before, but there is no direct coupling evidence linking them. Consequently, it is positioned at the bottom of the change set.\n\nIn summary, while all these entities have shown some level of co-change behavior historically, only `FunctionSQL` demonstrates significant technical reasons for needing synchronized changes with `FunctionCustom.java`. The remaining entities should be reviewed contextually for any indirect impacts or historical patterns that might necessitate updates.",

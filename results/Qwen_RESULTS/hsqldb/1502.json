Furthermore, there's an inheritance relationship where `WebServer` extends `Server`, making it highly likely that changes to `Server.java` will impact `WebServer.java`.\n\n2. **WebServerConnection**: With a support count of 4 and a confidence level of 0.4, this entity shows a strong co-change pattern with `Server.java`. The coupling analysis revealed type casting from `Server` to `WebServerConnection`, creation, and usage within methods like `handleConnection`, which indicates tight integration.\n\n3. **jdbcDatabaseMetaData**: This entity has been changed three times out of eight when `Server.java` was modified (confidence 0.375). While no direct coupling dependency was found through our function calls, the co-change relationship suggests potential indirect dependencies or shared functionality that might require synchronization.\n\n4. **ServerThread**: It shares a support count of 3 and a confidence level of 0.3. Although we didn't find any specific coupling details, its frequent appearance in co-changes implies a functional relationship worth investigating further for potential synchronization needs.\n\n5. **ServerConnection**: Similar to `ServerThread`, it also has a support count of 2 and a confidence level of 0.2. The low confidence suggests less immediate need for synchronization but should still be considered given the co-change history.\n\n6. **DatabaseManager**: This entity has a support count of 2 and a confidence level of 0.2, and similar to others with lower confidence levels, it may have some shared functionality or indirect dependencies with `Server.java`.\n\n7. **Session**: Also having a support count of 2 and a confidence level of 0.2, `Session` might share underlying mechanisms with `Server.java`, warranting consideration during change impact analysis.\n\n8. **Table**: It has a support count of 2 and a confidence level of 0.2. Its inclusion is based on the co-change relationship; however, without detailed coupling information, it's placed lower in the priority list.\n\n9. **Database**: This entity appears once in co-changes with `Server.java` (confidence 0.1). Given its foundational role in database systems, even a low confidence level does not completely rule out the possibility of needing synchronization.\n\n10. **ScriptReaderText**: With a single occurrence in co-changes (confidence 0.1), it is included due to its potential involvement in server-side script processing, which could be related to operations managed by `Server.java`.\n\n11. **HsqlProperties**: Lastly, it also appears once in co-changes with `Server.java`. Since properties files often contain configuration settings relevant across various components, changes to `Server.java` might necessitate updates to `HsqlProperties` as well.\n\nThis structured approach ensures that all potentially impacted entities are identified and prioritized for synchronization, reducing the risk of introducing bugs or missing necessary updates when modifying `Server.java`.",

Furthermore, there's an inheritance relationship where `WebServer` extends `Server`, making it highly likely that changes to `Server.java` will impact `WebServer.java`.\n\n2. **WebServerConnection**: With a support count of 4 and a confidence level of 0.4, this entity shows a strong co-change pattern with `Server.java`. The coupling analysis revealed type casting from `Server` to `WebServerConnection`, creation, and usage within methods like `handleConnection`, which indicates tight integration.\n\n3. **jdbcDatabaseMetaData**: This entity has been changed three times out of eight when `Server.java` was modified (confidence 0.375). While no direct coupling dependency was found through our function calls, the co-change relationship suggests potential indirect dependencies or shared functionality that might require synchronization.\n\n4. **ServerThread**: It shares a support count of 3 and a confidence level of 0.3. Although we didn't find any specific coupling details, its frequent appearance in co-changes implies a functional relationship worth investigating further for potential synchronization needs.\n\n5. **ServerConnection**: Similar to `ServerThread`, it also has a support count of 2 and a confidence level of 0.2. The low confidence suggests less immediate need for synchronization but should still be considered given the co-change history.\n\n6. **DatabaseManager**: This entity has a support count of 2 and a confidence level of 0.2, and similar to others with lower confidence levels, it may have some shared functionality or indirect dependencies with `Server.java`.\n\n7. **Session**: Also having a support count of 2 and a confidence level of 0.2, `Session` might share underlying mechanisms with `Server.java`, warranting consideration during change impact analysis.\n\n8. **Table**: It has a support count of 2 and a confidence level of 0.2. Its inclusion is based on the co-change relationship; however, without detailed coupling information, it's placed lower in the priority list.\n\n9. **Database**: This entity appears once in co-changes with `Server.java` (confidence 0.1). Given its foundational role in database systems, even a low confidence level does not completely rule out the possibility of needing synchronization.\n\n10. **ScriptReaderText**: With a single occurrence in co-changes (confidence 0.1), it is included due to its potential involvement in server-side script processing, which could be related to operations managed by `Server.java`.\n\n11. **HsqlProperties**: Lastly, it also appears once in co-changes with `Server.java`. Since properties files often contain configuration settings relevant across various components, changes to `Server.java` might necessitate updates to `HsqlProperties` as well.\n\nThis structured approach ensures that all potentially impacted entities are identified and prioritized for synchronization, reducing the risk of introducing bugs or missing necessary updates when modifying `Server.java`.",

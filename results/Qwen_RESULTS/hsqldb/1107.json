Although there are no direct coupling dependencies or call graph relationships, they have a conceptual coupling score of 0.839, indicating strong semantic similarity. Given the high confidence level and semantic similarity, it's highly likely that changes to `OdbcUtil.java` will require corresponding changes in `ServerConnection.java`.\n\n2. **TestOdbcTypes.java**: Similar to `ServerConnection.java`, `TestOdbcTypes.java` has a co-change relationship with `OdbcUtil.java` supported by one instance with a confidence of 1.0. The conceptual coupling score of 0.831 also indicates a strong semantic similarity. While there are no direct code interdependencies, the high confidence and semantic similarity suggest that `TestOdbcTypes.java` should be reviewed for necessary modifications when changes are made to `OdbcUtil.java`.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the analysis, both `ServerConnection.java` and `TestOdbcTypes.java` have shown a history of being modified alongside `OdbcUtil.java`. The lack of direct code dependencies does not rule out the need for synchronization due to their high conceptual coupling scores and perfect co-change confidence levels. Thus, it is recommended to consider these entities for synchronized changes whenever `OdbcUtil.java` undergoes modification. \n\nHere is the complete result from the function get_co_change_relationship:\n```json\n[[\"TestOdbcTypes\", \"1\", \"1.0\"], [\"ServerConnection\", \"1\", \"1.0\"]]\n```",

Although there are no direct coupling dependencies or call graph relationships, they have a conceptual coupling score of 0.839, indicating strong semantic similarity. Given the high confidence level and semantic similarity, it's highly likely that changes to `OdbcUtil.java` will require corresponding changes in `ServerConnection.java`.\n\n2. **TestOdbcTypes.java**: Similar to `ServerConnection.java`, `TestOdbcTypes.java` has a co-change relationship with `OdbcUtil.java` supported by one instance with a confidence of 1.0. The conceptual coupling score of 0.831 also indicates a strong semantic similarity. While there are no direct code interdependencies, the high confidence and semantic similarity suggest that `TestOdbcTypes.java` should be reviewed for necessary modifications when changes are made to `OdbcUtil.java`.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the analysis, both `ServerConnection.java` and `TestOdbcTypes.java` have shown a history of being modified alongside `OdbcUtil.java`. The lack of direct code dependencies does not rule out the need for synchronization due to their high conceptual coupling scores and perfect co-change confidence levels.

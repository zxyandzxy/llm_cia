Moreover, there is an inheritance relationship where `RowAction` extends `RowActionBase`. Additionally, the semantic similarity probability between these two entities is approximately 0.898, indicating strong conceptual coupling. Due to the combination of co-change history, structural dependency, and semantic similarity, `RowAction.java` is the most likely candidate that requires synchronized modifications.\n\n2. **Session.java**, **Table.java**, **LobManager.java**, **Error.java**, **ClientConnection.java**, **ParserDDL.java**, **TransactionManagerCommon.java**, **TransactionManagerMVCC.java**, **TransactionManagerMV2PL.java**: Each of these entities was changed once along with `RowActionBase.java`, yielding a confidence level of 0.5. Although there is no direct call graph or coupling dependencies detected between `RowActionBase.java` and these entities, their co-change history suggests some level of interaction or dependency within the context of the project's version history. Therefore, it is recommended to review these files when changes are made to `RowActionBase.java`.\n\nThe elements in the Change set are sorted in descending order of the likelihood of synchronized modifications, with `RowAction.java` being at the top due to its strong coupling through inheritance and high semantic similarity, followed by other entities based on their historical co-change frequency. It's important to note that while the latter entities have lower support and confidence values, they should still be considered during a comprehensive code review process to ensure all potential ripple effects are addressed.",

Moreover, there is an inheritance relationship where `RowAction` extends `RowActionBase`. Additionally, the semantic similarity probability between these two entities is approximately 0.898, indicating strong conceptual coupling. Due to the combination of co-change history, structural dependency, and semantic similarity, `RowAction.java` is the most likely candidate that requires synchronized modifications.\n\n2. **Session.java**, **Table.java**, **LobManager.java**, **Error.java**, **ClientConnection.java**, **ParserDDL.java**, **TransactionManagerCommon.java**, **TransactionManagerMVCC.java**, **TransactionManagerMV2PL.java**: Each of these entities was changed once along with `RowActionBase.java`, yielding a confidence level of 0.5. Although there is no direct call graph or coupling dependencies detected between `RowActionBase.java` and these entities, their co-change history suggests some level of interaction or dependency within the context of the project's version history. Therefore, it is recommended to review these files when changes are made to `RowActionBase.java`.\n\nThe elements in the Change set are sorted in descending order of the likelihood of synchronized modifications, with `RowAction.java` being at the top due to its strong coupling through inheritance and high semantic similarity, followed by other entities based on their historical co-change frequency. It's important to note that while the latter entities have lower support and confidence values, they should still be considered during a comprehensive code review process to ensure all potential ripple effects are addressed.",

Your task is to gradually explain which entity really need to be synchronized, based on the starting entity and the information obtained through the function-call.

It shares significant semantic relationships with `Scanner.java`, indicating that changes to `Scanner.java` are likely to necessitate corresponding changes to `Session`. Given the historical co-change pattern and the strong semantic relationship, it is highly probable that `Session` needs to be synchronized when modifying `Scanner.java`.\n\n2. **ExpressionColumn**: With an even higher conceptual coupling score (semantic similarity probability of 0.835), this entity is strongly related to `Scanner.java`. The shared concepts between these two entities suggest that they should be modified together. Therefore, `ExpressionColumn` is also very likely to require synchronization alongside changes to `Scanner.java`.\n\n3. **QuerySpecification**: Although there are no direct coupling dependencies or call graph interactions with `Scanner.java`, this entity has historically been changed together with `Scanner.java` every time (`support count = 1`, `confidence = 1.0`). This indicates a potential hidden dependency or common context that requires both entities to be updated concurrently.\n\n4. **RangeVariable**: Similar to `QuerySpecification`, `RangeVariable` has a perfect confidence score in co-change history with `Scanner.java`, suggesting that any modification to `Scanner.java` may need to be accompanied by changes to `RangeVariable`. However, without further evidence of structural dependencies or conceptual coupling, its priority for synchronization is lower compared to the first two entities.\n\n5. **ParserDQL**: Co-changed with `Scanner.java` in all instances (`support count = 1`, `confidence = 1.0`), implying a possible interrelated functionality or design decision affecting both entities. Though not directly coupled, the co-change pattern suggests that it should be considered for synchronization during changes to `Scanner.java`.\n\n6. **TransactionManagerMVCC**: This entity was always modified along with `Scanner.java` (`support count = 1`, `confidence = 1.0`). Despite lacking explicit coupling dependencies or call graph connections, its consistent co-change behavior implies a potential need for synchronization, albeit with less certainty than the preceding entities.\n\n7. **ClobInputStream**: Like the other entities listed, `ClobInputStream` has a support count of 1 and confidence of 1.0 in terms of co-change with `Scanner.java`. Its inclusion in the change set is based on the observed co-change pattern, but given the lack of additional supporting evidence from coupling or conceptual analysis, it ranks last in terms of the likelihood of needing synchronized modifications. \n\nIn summary, while all entities in the change set have shown a historical tendency to be modified together with `Scanner.java`, the prioritization reflects the strength of their relationships as determined through our analysis. Entities with stronger conceptual couplings like `Session` and `ExpressionColumn` are deemed more critical for synchronization.",

It shares significant semantic relationships with `Scanner.java`, indicating that changes to `Scanner.java` are likely to necessitate corresponding changes to `Session`. Given the historical co-change pattern and the strong semantic relationship, it is highly probable that `Session` needs to be synchronized when modifying `Scanner.java`.\n\n2. **ExpressionColumn**: With an even higher conceptual coupling score (semantic similarity probability of 0.835), this entity is strongly related to `Scanner.java`. The shared concepts between these two entities suggest that they should be modified together. Therefore, `ExpressionColumn` is also very likely to require synchronization alongside changes to `Scanner.java`.\n\n3. **QuerySpecification**: Although there are no direct coupling dependencies or call graph interactions with `Scanner.java`, this entity has historically been changed together with `Scanner.java` every time (`support count = 1`, `confidence = 1.0`). This indicates a potential hidden dependency or common context that requires both entities to be updated concurrently.\n\n4. **RangeVariable**: Similar to `QuerySpecification`, `RangeVariable` has a perfect confidence score in co-change history with `Scanner.java`, suggesting that any modification to `Scanner.java` may need to be accompanied by changes to `RangeVariable`. However, without further evidence of structural dependencies or conceptual coupling, its priority for synchronization is lower compared to the first two entities.\n\n5. **ParserDQL**: Co-changed with `Scanner.java` in all instances (`support count = 1`, `confidence = 1.0`), implying a possible interrelated functionality or design decision affecting both entities. Though not directly coupled, the co-change pattern suggests that it should be considered for synchronization during changes to `Scanner.java`.\n\n6. **TransactionManagerMVCC**: This entity was always modified along with `Scanner.java` (`support count = 1`, `confidence = 1.0`). Despite lacking explicit coupling dependencies or call graph connections, its consistent co-change behavior implies a potential need for synchronization, albeit with less certainty than the preceding entities.\n\n7. **ClobInputStream**: Like the other entities listed, `ClobInputStream` has a support count of 1 and confidence of 1.0 in terms of co-change with `Scanner.java`. Its inclusion in the change set is based on the observed co-change pattern, but given the lack of additional supporting evidence from coupling or conceptual analysis, it ranks last in terms of the likelihood of needing synchronized modifications. \n\nIn summary, while all entities in the change set have shown a historical tendency to be modified together with `Scanner.java`, the prioritization reflects the strength of their relationships as determined through our analysis. Entities with stronger conceptual couplings like `Session` and `ExpressionColumn` are deemed more critical for synchronization.",

Moreover, it has a high conceptual coupling score of approximately 0.755, which suggests that changes in `ResultLob.java` are very likely to necessitate corresponding changes in `LobManager.java`.\n\n2. **JDBCPreparedStatement.java**: Although there is no direct evidence of coupling dependencies between this entity and `LobManager.java`, it appears in the co-change results with a support count of 2 and confidence level of 0.4. This implies that whenever `LobManager.java` was changed, `JDBCPreparedStatement.java` was also modified in 50% of those cases, indicating a moderate likelihood of needing synchronization.\n\n3. **SessionData.java**: Similar to `JDBCPreparedStatement.java`, this entity has been co-changed with `LobManager.java` twice out of ten times, resulting in a confidence level of 0.4. However, since there are no coupling dependencies found, the need for synchronization is less certain compared to entities with stronger ties.\n\n4. **HsqlByteArrayOutputStream.java**: This entity is called by `LobManager.java`, indicating a direct usage relationship. Changes affecting how `LobManager.java` uses byte arrays could potentially require adjustments in `HsqlByteArrayOutputStream.java`.\n\n5. **BlobDataID.java**, **ClobData.java**, **ClobDataID.java**, **BlobData.java**: These entities are directly used by `LobManager.java`. Given their roles in handling binary and character large objects, any changes in `LobManager.java`'s handling of LOBs (Large OBjects) may affect these classes, requiring them to be updated accordingly.\n\n6. **Result.java**, **ResultMetaData.java**: Both of these entities are involved in managing query results and metadata respectively, and they are directly used within `LobManager.java`. As such, changes related to result processing or metadata management in `LobManager.java` might impact these entities, suggesting the need for potential synchronization.\n\n7. **RowSetNavigator.java**: It is directly used by `LobManager.java`, indicating that navigational behavior over row sets could be impacted by changes in `LobManager.java`. Thus, it should be considered for synchronization if relevant functionality is altered.\n\nIn summary, based on the analysis using co-change relationships, coupling dependencies, and conceptual coupling, `ResultLob.java` stands out as the primary candidate for synchronized changes alongside `LobManager.java`.

Moreover, it has a high conceptual coupling score of approximately 0.755, which suggests that changes in `ResultLob.java` are very likely to necessitate corresponding changes in `LobManager.java`.\n\n2. **JDBCPreparedStatement.java**: Although there is no direct evidence of coupling dependencies between this entity and `LobManager.java`, it appears in the co-change results with a support count of 2 and confidence level of 0.4. This implies that whenever `LobManager.java` was changed, `JDBCPreparedStatement.java` was also modified in 50% of those cases, indicating a moderate likelihood of needing synchronization.\n\n3. **SessionData.java**: Similar to `JDBCPreparedStatement.java`, this entity has been co-changed with `LobManager.java` twice out of ten times, resulting in a confidence level of 0.4. However, since there are no coupling dependencies found, the need for synchronization is less certain compared to entities with stronger ties.\n\n4. **HsqlByteArrayOutputStream.java**: This entity is called by `LobManager.java`, indicating a direct usage relationship. Changes affecting how `LobManager.java` uses byte arrays could potentially require adjustments in `HsqlByteArrayOutputStream.java`.\n\n5. **BlobDataID.java**, **ClobData.java**, **ClobDataID.java**, **BlobData.java**: These entities are directly used by `LobManager.java`. Given their roles in handling binary and character large objects, any changes in `LobManager.java`'s handling of LOBs (Large OBjects) may affect these classes, requiring them to be updated accordingly.\n\n6. **Result.java**, **ResultMetaData.java**: Both of these entities are involved in managing query results and metadata respectively, and they are directly used within `LobManager.java`. As such, changes related to result processing or metadata management in `LobManager.java` might impact these entities, suggesting the need for potential synchronization.\n\n7. **RowSetNavigator.java**: It is directly used by `LobManager.java`, indicating that navigational behavior over row sets could be impacted by changes in `LobManager.java`. Thus, it should be considered for synchronization if relevant functionality is altered.\n\nIn summary, based on the analysis using co-change relationships, coupling dependencies, and conceptual coupling, `ResultLob.java` stands out as the primary candidate for synchronized changes alongside `LobManager.java`.

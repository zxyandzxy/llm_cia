In order to help solve the CIA mission, you should first understand some necessary concepts\uff1a\n(1)entity: Entities represent source code files in CIA tasks, and all the CIA tasks under study are based on the Java language, so entities are files with the .java extension.\n(2)starting entity: The starting entity is also called salient entity, and the salient entity is the root change that causes the modification of the rest of entities in a change set, while the rest of entities are the dependency modification along with the salient one.\nYou will be presented with a starting entity and tools (functions) will be provided to access the more information of the origin system. Your task is to gradually explain which entity really need to be synchronized, based on the starting entity and the information obtained through the function-call. You have 7 chances to call the function to get more information."

The co-changes indicate a potential indirect relationship between these files.\n\n4. **Expression**: Similar to `Table`, `Expression` has been changed concurrently with `Token.java` 3 times, warranting consideration for review during modifications to `Token.java`.\n\n5. **Session**: Having 2 supports and a confidence of 0.182, `Session` is another entity that frequently co-changes with `Token.java`. Although the confidence is lower than the previous entries, its frequent co-changes suggest it could be impacted by changes in `Token.java`.\n\n6. **Cache**: Like `Session`, `Cache` also has 2 supports and a confidence of 0.182.

Given its co-change history with `Token.java`, it should be considered for review when changes are made to `Token.java`.\n\n8. **ScriptWriterText**: With 2 supports and a confidence of 0.182, this entity has shown a moderate tendency to change alongside `Token.java`. Thus, it should be included in the list of files to check for possible synchronization needs.\n\n9. **Function**: Also appearing twice in conjunction with `Token.java` changes (confidence of 0.182), `Function` should be considered for potential synchronization efforts.\n\n10. **DatabaseInformationFull**: Lastly, this entity has appeared in 2 out of the 8 changes of `Token.java` (confidence of 0.182). It should be monitored for necessary updates when `Token.java` is modified.\n\nEach of these entities appears in the version history of `Token.java` multiple times, indicating a pattern where changes to `Token.java` often coincide with changes to these files.

Despite the lack of direct coupling dependencies, it's likely that changes in `Token.java` may necessitate corresponding changes in `Parser` due to shared functionality or context.\n\n2. **DatabaseScript**: This entity has been modified alongside `Token.java` three times, giving it a confidence of 0.273. It suggests that these two entities are often changed together, possibly because they interact within the same feature or module.\n\n3. **Table**: Also having a confidence of 0.273 based on 3 supports, `Table` might need to be reviewed for synchronization when changes occur in `Token.java`. The co-changes indicate a potential indirect relationship between these files.\n\n4. **Expression**: Similar to `Table`, `Expression` has been changed concurrently with `Token.java` 3 times, warranting consideration for review during modifications to `Token.java`.\n\n5. **Session**: Having 2 supports and a confidence of 0.182, `Session` is another entity that frequently co-changes with `Token.java`. Although the confidence is lower than the previous entries, its frequent co-changes suggest it could be impacted by changes in `Token.java`.\n\n6. **Cache**: Like `Session`, `Cache` also has 2 supports and a confidence of 0.182. Its co-change pattern with `Token.java` suggests that there may be related functionalities that require concurrent updates.\n\n7. **ScaledRAFile**: This entity shares the same number of supports and confidence as `Cache` and `Session`. Given its co-change history with `Token.java`, it should be considered for review when changes are made to `Token.java`.\n\n8. **ScriptWriterText**: With 2 supports and a confidence of 0.182, this entity has shown a moderate tendency to change alongside `Token.java`. Thus, it should be included in the list of files to check for possible synchronization needs.\n\n9. **Function**: Also appearing twice in conjunction with `Token.java` changes (confidence of 0.182), `Function` should be considered for potential synchronization efforts.\n\n10. **DatabaseInformationFull**: Lastly, this entity has appeared in 2 out of the 8 changes of `Token.java` (confidence of 0.182).

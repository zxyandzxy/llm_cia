In order to help solve the CIA mission, you should first understand some necessary concepts\uff1a\n(1)entity: Entities represent source code files in CIA tasks, and all the CIA tasks under study are based on the Java language, so entities are files with the .java extension.\n(2)starting entity: The starting entity is also called salient entity, and the salient entity is the root change that causes the modification of the rest of entities in a change set, while the rest of entities are the dependency modification along with the salient one.\nYou will be presented with a starting entity and tools (functions) will be provided to access the more information of the origin system. Your task is to gradually explain which entity really need to be synchronized, based on the starting entity and the information obtained through the function-call. You have 7 chances to call the function to get more information."

Here's an explanation for each entity:\n\n1. **TextTable.java**: This entity has been changed 5 times along with `TextCache.java`, showing a confidence level of 0.625. Moreover, it has a high conceptual coupling probability (0.843), indicating that both entities share similar functionality or logic. Therefore, changes to `TextCache.java` should likely be synchronized with `TextTable.java`.\n\n2. **RowStoreAVLDiskData.java**: It appeared 4 times alongside `TextCache.java` with a confidence of 0.5. Although there is no direct coupling dependency, frequent co-changes suggest a functional relationship that may require synchronization.\n\n3. **DataFileCache.java**: Changed 3 times concurrently with `TextCache.java` with a confidence of 0.375. Similar to `RowStoreAVLDiskData.java`, the lack of direct coupling does not preclude the need for coordinated changes due to shared responsibilities or dependencies within the system architecture.\n\n4. **Log.java** & **Cache.java**: Both entities were modified 2 times together with `TextCache.java`, with a confidence of 0.25. While they have lower confidence levels compared to the top three, their repeated co-changes imply some degree of interdependence that warrants consideration for change synchronization.\n\n5. **NIOScaledRAFile.java**, **ScaledRAFile.java**, **DatabaseInformationFull.java**, **Logger.java**, **ScaledRAFileInJar.java**, **TransactionManagerMV2PL.java**, **NumberType.java**, **IndexAVL.java**, **IndexAVLMemory.java**, **RowAVLDiskData.java**, **NodeAVLDisk.java**, **NodeAVLMemoryPointer.java**, **StatementSession.java**, **StringUtil.java**, **SchemaManager.java**, **TextFileReader.java**, **HsqlByteArrayOutputStream.java**: These entities showed a single co-change occurrence with `TextCache.java`, each having a confidence level of 0.125. Their inclusion in the change set is based on historical patterns but may not necessarily indicate a strong need for synchronized changes unless further evidence suggests otherwise.\n\nThe entities listed above represent potential candidates for synchronized changes when modifying `TextCache.java`.

Here's an explanation for each entity:\n\n1. **TextTable.java**: This entity has been changed 5 times along with `TextCache.java`, showing a confidence level of 0.625. Moreover, it has a high conceptual coupling probability (0.843), indicating that both entities share similar functionality or logic. Therefore, changes to `TextCache.java` should likely be synchronized with `TextTable.java`.\n\n2. **RowStoreAVLDiskData.java**: It appeared 4 times alongside `TextCache.java` with a confidence of 0.5. Although there is no direct coupling dependency, frequent co-changes suggest a functional relationship that may require synchronization.\n\n3. **DataFileCache.java**: Changed 3 times concurrently with `TextCache.java` with a confidence of 0.375. Similar to `RowStoreAVLDiskData.java`, the lack of direct coupling does not preclude the need for coordinated changes due to shared responsibilities or dependencies within the system architecture.\n\n4. **Log.java** & **Cache.java**: Both entities were modified 2 times together with `TextCache.java`, with a confidence of 0.25. While they have lower confidence levels compared to the top three, their repeated co-changes imply some degree of interdependence that warrants consideration for change synchronization.\n\n5. **NIOScaledRAFile.java**, **ScaledRAFile.java**, **DatabaseInformationFull.java**, **Logger.java**, **ScaledRAFileInJar.java**, **TransactionManagerMV2PL.java**, **NumberType.java**, **IndexAVL.java**, **IndexAVLMemory.java**, **RowAVLDiskData.java**, **NodeAVLDisk.java**, **NodeAVLMemoryPointer.java**, **StatementSession.java**, **StringUtil.java**, **SchemaManager.java**, **TextFileReader.java**, **HsqlByteArrayOutputStream.java**: These entities showed a single co-change occurrence with `TextCache.java`, each having a confidence level of 0.125. Their inclusion in the change set is based on historical patterns but may not necessarily indicate a strong need for synchronized changes unless further evidence suggests otherwise.\n\nThe entities listed above represent potential candidates for synchronized changes when modifying `TextCache.java`.

However, since `DatabaseManager.java` uses `HsqlProperties.java`, changes in `DatabaseManager.java` could still impact `HsqlProperties.java` if they involve properties or configurations used by the database manager.\n\nBased on our analysis so far:\n- We identified a strong co-change relationship between `DatabaseManager.java` and `DatabaseManagerSwing.java`.\n- There is no direct coupling dependency between these two files, but there is a significant conceptual coupling.\n- The call graph indicates that `DatabaseManager.java` uses `HsqlProperties.java`, among other standard utility classes and data structures.\n\nTo conclude, the entity `DatabaseManagerSwing.java` should definitely be synchronized when changes are made to `DatabaseManager.java` due to their high co-change frequency and conceptual similarity. Additionally, although not showing a strong co-change relationship, `HsqlProperties.java` may also need to be reviewed for potential synchronization based on the usage context within `DatabaseManager.java`.\n\nSince we have exhausted our available calls, the final recommendation is to focus on synchronizing changes with `DatabaseManagerSwing.java` and consider reviewing `HsqlProperties.java` during any modifications to `DatabaseManager.java`.

Changes in `DatabaseManager.java` could affect properties or configurations managed by `HsqlProperties`, making it necessary to review and potentially synchronize this entity.\n\n3. **DatabaseManagerCommon**:\n   - Support: 1, Confidence: 0.2\n   - While the support and confidence levels are lower compared to `DatabaseManagerSwing`, this entity shares part of its name with `DatabaseManager.java`, suggesting a functional relationship. Given the low confidence, it may require less attention but should still be considered during modifications due to potential shared functionality.\n\n4. **ScriptWriterText**, **QueryTool**, **TransferCommon**, **Server**, **Notified**, **ServerConstants**:\n   - These entities have been included based on their co-change relationship with `DatabaseManager.java`. Each has a support count of 1 and a confidence level of 0.2. They are listed last because their need for synchronization is less evident than for the top two entities. However, since they have shown some co-change history with `DatabaseManager.java`, they should not be entirely disregarded during the modification process.\n\nThe elements in the Change set are sorted in descending order of the likelihood of synchronized modifications, starting with those most likely to require synchronization (`DatabaseManagerSwing`) down to those least likely but still worth considering (entities with support count 1 and confidence level 0.2).",

Moreover, `PersistentStore` is directly called by `NodeAVLDisk.java`, and they have a significant conceptual coupling with a semantic similarity probability of 0.7901.

Although there is no provided evidence of direct interaction or coupling dependencies between `NodeAVLDisk.java` and these entities, their consistent co-occurrence during past changes suggests a high likelihood of needing synchronized modifications.\n\nIn summary, while `PersistentStore` stands out due to its additional interactions and semantic relevance with `NodeAVLDisk.java`, the rest of the entities listed also exhibit a pattern of being changed together and should be considered for synchronization when `NodeAVLDisk.java` is modified.

This relatively high score indicates that the two entities are semantically related, which might explain why they often change together and directly interact with each other.\n\nGiven the results from our analysis:\n- Co-change relationship: `PersistentStore` changes every time `NodeAVLDisk.java` is changed.\n- Call graph: `NodeAVLDisk.java` directly interacts with `PersistentStore`.\n- Conceptual coupling: There's a significant semantic relationship between `NodeAVLDisk.java` and `PersistentStore`.\n\nBased on these findings, it is strongly recommended to synchronize `PersistentStore` whenever `NodeAVLDisk.java` is modified.\n\nSince we have used up our function calls for investigation, let's summarize the outcome:\n\n- **Synchronize `PersistentStore`:** Due to its co-change history, direct interaction, and semantic relevance with `NodeAVLDisk.java`.\n- **Consider Synchronizing Other Entities:** While not directly interacting or having strong coupling dependencies with `NodeAVLDisk.java`, the entities listed in the co-change relationship (`RowStoreAVL`, `IndexAVL`, etc.) should also be considered for synchronization due to their historical pattern of being changed together.\n\nThis concludes the change impact analysis for `NodeAVLDisk.java`.

Moreover, `PersistentStore` is directly called by `NodeAVLDisk.java`, and they have a significant conceptual coupling with a semantic similarity probability of 0.7901.

Although there is no provided evidence of direct interaction or coupling dependencies between `NodeAVLDisk.java` and these entities, their consistent co-occurrence during past changes suggests a high likelihood of needing synchronized modifications.\n\nIn summary, while `PersistentStore` stands out due to its additional interactions and semantic relevance with `NodeAVLDisk.java`, the rest of the entities listed also exhibit a pattern of being changed together and should be considered for synchronization when `NodeAVLDisk.java` is modified.

Additionally, it shares a strong conceptual similarity score of approximately 0.843, indicating that changes to `TextCache.java` are highly likely to require corresponding changes in `TextTable.java`.\n\n- **RowStoreAVLDiskData.java**: With the second-highest number of supports (4) and a confidence of 0.5, this entity also shows a significant likelihood of needing synchronized modifications when `TextCache.java` is changed. The conceptual coupling between these two files is even stronger than that with `TextTable.java`, at about 0.850.\n\n- **DataFileCache.java**: This entity appears in the co-change list with 3 supports and a confidence of 0.375. Although there's no direct coupling dependency or conceptual similarity data provided here, its frequent appearance alongside `TextCache.java` changes suggests a potential need for synchronization.\n\n- **Cache.java**: Having 2 supports and a confidence of 0.25, `Cache.java` may not be as strongly related as the first two entities, but given its name and purpose, it might share some functionality with `TextCache.java`, making it a candidate for synchronization.\n\n- **Log.java & Logger.java**: Both logging-related entities have 2 and 1 support respectively, with confidences of 0.25 and 0.125. While their co-change frequency is lower, logging is often intertwined with caching mechanisms for debugging and performance monitoring purposes.\n\n- **SchemaManager.java**: With 1 support and a confidence of 0.125, this entity's connection to `TextCache.java` is less evident. However, schema management could be indirectly affected by cache operations, especially if those operations influence database structures or metadata.\n\n- **TransactionManagerMV2PL.java**: Also having 1 support and a confidence of 0.125, this transaction manager could be impacted by changes to caching strategies, particularly if they affect transactional integrity or concurrency control.\n\nThe elements in the Change set are sorted in descending order of the likelihood of synchronized modifications based on the co-change relationships and conceptual couplings identified during the analysis.

Additionally, it shares a strong conceptual similarity score of approximately 0.843, indicating that changes to `TextCache.java` are highly likely to require corresponding changes in `TextTable.java`.\n\n- **RowStoreAVLDiskData.java**: With the second-highest number of supports (4) and a confidence of 0.5, this entity also shows a significant likelihood of needing synchronized modifications when `TextCache.java` is changed. The conceptual coupling between these two files is even stronger than that with `TextTable.java`, at about 0.850.\n\n- **DataFileCache.java**: This entity appears in the co-change list with 3 supports and a confidence of 0.375. Although there's no direct coupling dependency or conceptual similarity data provided here, its frequent appearance alongside `TextCache.java` changes suggests a potential need for synchronization.\n\n- **Cache.java**: Having 2 supports and a confidence of 0.25, `Cache.java` may not be as strongly related as the first two entities, but given its name and purpose, it might share some functionality with `TextCache.java`, making it a candidate for synchronization.\n\n- **Log.java & Logger.java**: Both logging-related entities have 2 and 1 support respectively, with confidences of 0.25 and 0.125. While their co-change frequency is lower, logging is often intertwined with caching mechanisms for debugging and performance monitoring purposes.\n\n- **SchemaManager.java**: With 1 support and a confidence of 0.125, this entity's connection to `TextCache.java` is less evident. However, schema management could be indirectly affected by cache operations, especially if those operations influence database structures or metadata.\n\n- **TransactionManagerMV2PL.java**: Also having 1 support and a confidence of 0.125, this transaction manager could be impacted by changes to caching strategies, particularly if they affect transactional integrity or concurrency control.\n\nThe elements in the Change set are sorted in descending order of the likelihood of synchronized modifications based on the co-change relationships and conceptual couplings identified during the analysis.

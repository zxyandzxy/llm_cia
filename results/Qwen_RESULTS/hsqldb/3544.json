In order to help solve the CIA mission, you should first understand some necessary concepts\uff1a\n(1)entity: Entities represent source code files in CIA tasks, and all the CIA tasks under study are based on the Java language, so entities are files with the .java extension.\n(2)starting entity: The starting entity is also called salient entity, and the salient entity is the root change that causes the modification of the rest of entities in a change set, while the rest of entities are the dependency modification along with the salient one.\nYou will be presented with a starting entity and tools (functions) will be provided to access the more information of the origin system. Your task is to gradually explain which entity really need to be synchronized, based on the starting entity and the information obtained through the function-call. You have 7 chances to call the function to get more information."

Additionally, it shares a high conceptual coupling with `JDBCResultSet.java` (semantic similarity probability of 0.864). Given that both entities are frequently modified together and have overlapping functionality, changes to `JDBCResultSet.java` should be accompanied by modifications to `JDBCPreparedStatement.java`.\n\n2. **JDBCStatementBase.java**: With a support value of 5 and a confidence level of 0.357, this entity is also significantly correlated with `JDBCResultSet.java`. Although its conceptual coupling was not explicitly calculated, the co-change relationship suggests that it may need synchronization when changes occur in `JDBCResultSet.java`.\n\n3. **Session.java**: This entity appears in the co-change results with 3 supports and a confidence level of 0.214. It represents an important part of the session management within the system, which is likely used by `JDBCResultSet.java` for database interactions. Therefore, changes in `JDBCResultSet.java` could impact how sessions are managed.\n\n4. **JDBCCallableStatement.java**: Having 4 supports and a confidence level of 0.286, this entity is moderately correlated with `JDBCResultSet.java`.

Additionally, it shares a high conceptual coupling with `JDBCResultSet.java` (semantic similarity probability of 0.864).

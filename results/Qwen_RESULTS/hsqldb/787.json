Your task is to gradually explain which entity really need to be synchronized, based on the starting entity and the information obtained through the function-call.

Additionally, it has a high conceptual coupling probability (approximately 0.843) with `SqlFile.java`, indicating that they share similar functionality or processes. Changes in `SqlFile.java` should prompt a review and potential updates to `SqlTool.java`.\n\n2. **RefCapablePropertyResourceBundle.java**: Although there are no direct coupling dependencies or call graph connections between this entity and `SqlFile.java`, it has a significant number of supports (9) and a confidence level of 0.25. This suggests that changes in `SqlFile.java` often coincide with changes in `RefCapablePropertyResourceBundle.java`, likely due to higher-level design considerations.\n\n3. **SqltoolRB.java**: With 13 supports and a confidence of approximately 0.361, this entity also shows a strong co-change relationship with `SqlFile.java`. It is part of the same resource bundle family as `RefCapablePropertyResourceBundle.java`, which further justifies its inclusion in the change set for synchronized modification.\n\n4. **RCData.java**: Having 6 supports and a confidence of approximately 0.167, this entity appears in both the co-change results and the call graph from `SqlFile.java`. The dual presence indicates a moderate likelihood of needing synchronization when `SqlFile.java` is modified.\n\n5. **ValidatingResourceBundle.java**: Similarly to `RCData.java`, this entity has 6 supports and a confidence of approximately 0.167. It also appeared in the call graph, suggesting that changes in `SqlFile.java` may require adjustments in `ValidatingResourceBundle.java`.\n\n6. **TokenList.java**: This entity was identified in the call graph from `SqlFile.java` and has 3 supports with a confidence of approximately 0.083. While not as strongly correlated as the top entities, its direct usage within `SqlFile.java` merits consideration during any modifications.\n\n7. **AppendableException.java**: Appearing in the call graph from `SqlFile.java` and having 4 supports with a confidence of approximately 0.111, this entity represents another dependency worth reviewing for potential changes alongside `SqlFile.java`.\n\n8. **SqlFileScanner.java**: Lastly, this entity, found in the call graph and with 4 supports and a confidence of approximately 0.111, completes our change set. Its connection through method calls implies that changes in `SqlFile.java` could affect `SqlFileScanner.java` as well.\n\nIn conclusion, while some entities like `SqlTool.java` have stronger evidence pointing towards necessary synchronization, others such as `RefCapablePropertyResourceBundle.java` and `SqltoolRB.java` should also be reviewed based on historical co-change patterns. Entities directly referenced in the call graph (`RCData.java`, `ValidatingResourceBundle.java`, `TokenList.java`, `AppendableException.java`, and `SqlFileScanner.java`) complete the prioritized list for synchronized changes.",

Additionally, it has a high conceptual coupling probability (approximately 0.843) with `SqlFile.java`, indicating that they share similar functionality or processes. Changes in `SqlFile.java` should prompt a review and potential updates to `SqlTool.java`.\n\n2. **RefCapablePropertyResourceBundle.java**: Although there are no direct coupling dependencies or call graph connections between this entity and `SqlFile.java`, it has a significant number of supports (9) and a confidence level of 0.25. This suggests that changes in `SqlFile.java` often coincide with changes in `RefCapablePropertyResourceBundle.java`, likely due to higher-level design considerations.\n\n3. **SqltoolRB.java**: With 13 supports and a confidence of approximately 0.361, this entity also shows a strong co-change relationship with `SqlFile.java`. It is part of the same resource bundle family as `RefCapablePropertyResourceBundle.java`, which further justifies its inclusion in the change set for synchronized modification.\n\n4. **RCData.java**: Having 6 supports and a confidence of approximately 0.167, this entity appears in both the co-change results and the call graph from `SqlFile.java`. The dual presence indicates a moderate likelihood of needing synchronization when `SqlFile.java` is modified.\n\n5. **ValidatingResourceBundle.java**: Similarly to `RCData.java`, this entity has 6 supports and a confidence of approximately 0.167. It also appeared in the call graph, suggesting that changes in `SqlFile.java` may require adjustments in `ValidatingResourceBundle.java`.\n\n6. **TokenList.java**: This entity was identified in the call graph from `SqlFile.java` and has 3 supports with a confidence of approximately 0.083. While not as strongly correlated as the top entities, its direct usage within `SqlFile.java` merits consideration during any modifications.\n\n7. **AppendableException.java**: Appearing in the call graph from `SqlFile.java` and having 4 supports with a confidence of approximately 0.111, this entity represents another dependency worth reviewing for potential changes alongside `SqlFile.java`.\n\n8. **SqlFileScanner.java**: Lastly, this entity, found in the call graph and with 4 supports and a confidence of approximately 0.111, completes our change set. Its connection through method calls implies that changes in `SqlFile.java` could affect `SqlFileScanner.java` as well.\n\nIn conclusion, while some entities like `SqlTool.java` have stronger evidence pointing towards necessary synchronization, others such as `RefCapablePropertyResourceBundle.java` and `SqltoolRB.java` should also be reviewed based on historical co-change patterns. Entities directly referenced in the call graph (`RCData.java`, `ValidatingResourceBundle.java`, `TokenList.java`, `AppendableException.java`, and `SqlFileScanner.java`) complete the prioritized list for synchronized changes.",

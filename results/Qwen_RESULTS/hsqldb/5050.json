However, since `StatementCommand.java` has a relatively high confidence level in the co-change relationship, it should still be considered for synchronization when changes occur in `Logger.java`.\n\nSince we have discovered no direct coupling, let's now check the conceptual coupling between `Logger.java` and `StatementCommand.java` using the `get_conceptual_coupling` function.

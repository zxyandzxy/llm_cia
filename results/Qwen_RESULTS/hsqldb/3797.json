In order to help solve the CIA mission, you should first understand some necessary concepts\uff1a\n(1)entity: Entities represent source code files in CIA tasks, and all the CIA tasks under study are based on the Java language, so entities are files with the .java extension.\n(2)starting entity: The starting entity is also called salient entity, and the salient entity is the root change that causes the modification of the rest of entities in a change set, while the rest of entities are the dependency modification along with the salient one.\nYou will be presented with a starting entity and tools (functions) will be provided to access the more information of the origin system. Your task is to gradually explain which entity really need to be synchronized, based on the starting entity and the information obtained through the function-call.

Although there are no direct call or coupling dependencies, the combination of co-change history and semantic similarity suggests that it might be necessary to synchronize changes when modifying `StringConverter.java`.\n\n2. **Crypto**: Similarly, this entity shares a co-change relationship with `StringConverter.java` (support count: 1, confidence: 1.0) and has an even higher semantic similarity score of 0.8657511. The strong conceptual coupling indicates that changes to `StringConverter.java` could potentially require changes to `Crypto`, despite the lack of direct dependencies.\n\n3. **ScriptReaderDecode**: This entity also has a co-change relationship with `StringConverter.java` (support count: 1, confidence: 1.0). However, the absence of both direct dependencies and information about semantic similarity makes it less certain that it needs to be synchronized. Nonetheless, given its co-change history with `StringConverter.java`, it is included in the change set as a precautionary measure.\n\nIn summary, while the evidence for synchronization is stronger for `ScriptReaderText` and `Crypto` due to their semantic similarities and co-change histories, all three entities should be considered for potential synchronized modifications when `StringConverter.java` is changed.

Your task is to gradually explain which entity really need to be synchronized, based on the starting entity and the information obtained through the function-call.

Although there are no direct call or coupling dependencies, the combination of co-change history and semantic similarity suggests that it might be necessary to synchronize changes when modifying `StringConverter.java`.\n\n2. **Crypto**: Similarly, this entity shares a co-change relationship with `StringConverter.java` (support count: 1, confidence: 1.0) and has an even higher semantic similarity score of 0.8657511. The strong conceptual coupling indicates that changes to `StringConverter.java` could potentially require changes to `Crypto`, despite the lack of direct dependencies.\n\n3. **ScriptReaderDecode**: This entity also has a co-change relationship with `StringConverter.java` (support count: 1, confidence: 1.0). However, the absence of both direct dependencies and information about semantic similarity makes it less certain that it needs to be synchronized. Nonetheless, given its co-change history with `StringConverter.java`, it is included in the change set as a precautionary measure.\n\nIn summary, while the evidence for synchronization is stronger for `ScriptReaderText` and `Crypto` due to their semantic similarities and co-change histories, all three entities should be considered for potential synchronized modifications when `StringConverter.java` is changed.

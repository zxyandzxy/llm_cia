Your task is to gradually explain which entity really need to be synchronized, based on the starting entity and the information obtained through the function-call.

Furthermore, the conceptual coupling between these two entities is high at approximately 0.842921, indicating that they share significant semantic similarities.

It's part of the query parsing process, which might be related to database properties settings.\n\n3. **StatementCommand**: Appeared alongside `HsqlDatabaseProperties.java` 6 times, with a confidence score of 0.46153846153846156. As it handles command statements, it may need adjustments when there are changes in database property configurations.\n\n4. **ParserCommand**: Similarly to `ParserDQL`, it has been changed along with `HsqlDatabaseProperties.java` 6 times, suggesting a dependency on property settings for its command parsing functionality.\n\n5. **Database**: The confidence score of 0.38461538461538464 and appearing in 5 modifications indicates a moderate likelihood of needing synchronized changes due to its central role in managing database properties and configurations.\n\n6. **Session**: With a confidence score of 0.3076923076923077 and appearing in 4 modifications, `Session` manages user sessions and interactions with the database, potentially requiring updates when property settings change.\n\n7. **StatementSchema**: Appearing in 2 modifications with a confidence score of 0.15384615384615385, it deals with schema statements, which can be affected by changes in database properties.\n\n8. **RangeVariable**: Also appearing in 2 modifications with a confidence score of 0.15384615384615385, it is involved in range operations that could depend on specific property settings.\n\n9. **StatementCompound**: With a confidence score of 0.15384615384615385 and appearing in 2 modifications, it involves complex SQL statement handling, which might require updates based on new property settings.\n\n10. **ExpressionAggregate**: Similar to `StatementCompound`, it appeared in 2 modifications and shares the same confidence score.

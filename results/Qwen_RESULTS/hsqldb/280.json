Moreover, the `get_conceptual_coupling` function revealed a high semantic similarity of approximately 0.808 between these two files. This indicates a strong conceptual relationship and suggests that changes to `SqltoolRB.java` may require corresponding modifications in `SqlTool.java` to maintain consistency.\n\n2. **SqlFile.java**: Similar to `SqlTool.java`, the file `SqlFile.java` also appears to be historically co-changed with `SqltoolRB.java` with the same support count of 1 and confidence of 0.5. Although there are no direct coupling dependencies or method calls, the semantic similarity measured by `get_conceptual_coupling` is about 0.717, indicating a moderate conceptual relationship. Therefore, it's prudent to consider `SqlFile.java` for synchronized changes when modifying `SqltoolRB.java`.\n\nIn summary, based on historical co-change patterns and conceptual relationships, both `SqlTool.java` and `SqlFile.java` should be considered for synchronized modifications when changes are made to `SqltoolRB.java`.

Although there are no direct coupling dependencies or method calls, the semantic similarity measured by `get_conceptual_coupling` is about 0.717, indicating a moderate conceptual relationship. Therefore, it's prudent to consider `SqlFile.java` for synchronized changes when modifying `SqltoolRB.java`.\n\nIn summary, based on historical co-change patterns and conceptual relationships, both `SqlTool.java` and `SqlFile.java` should be considered for synchronized modifications when changes are made to `SqltoolRB.java`.

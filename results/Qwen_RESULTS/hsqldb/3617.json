Therefore, while it might be worth keeping an eye on, it's less critical to synchronize compared to `Database.java`.\n\nConsidering our remaining function calls, we could further investigate other entities from the co-change list or check the conceptual coupling between `SchemaManager.java` and some of these entities to see if there is a semantic relationship that may suggest they should be changed together. However, based on the current findings, it seems prudent to focus on `Database.java` as the primary entity to synchronize with `SchemaManager.java`.\n\nIf you agree, we can conclude that `Database.java` needs to be synchronized when `SchemaManager.java` is modified.

The coupling analysis revealed multiple instances where `SchemaManager.java` accesses or invokes methods and variables from `Database.java`.\n\n2. **ParserDDL.java**: Although this entity appears in the co-change history with `SchemaManager.java` (support: 2, confidence: 0.25), there are no direct coupling dependencies between them. Therefore, it is less critical but still worth considering for synchronization.\n\n3. **QuerySpecification.java**: Appears once in the co-change history with `SchemaManager.java`, indicating that it might be modified together, albeit with lower support and confidence.\n\n4. **BaseHashMap.java**, **StatementCommand.java**, **SchemaObjectSet.java**, **TestStoredProcedure.java**, **TestMerge.java**, **RangeVariableResolver.java**, **Schema.java**, **StatementDML.java**, **RowInputTextLog.java**, **RowStoreAVL.java**, **RowStoreAVLHybrid.java**, **DatabaseInformationFull.java**, **DatabaseInformationMain.java**, **IndexAVL.java**, **Cache.java**, **TransactionManagerCommon.java**, **JDBCArray.java**, **JDBCPreparedStatement.java**: These entities all have low support and confidence values (each appearing only once in the co-change history). They are included in the change set based on their co-change relationship but are less likely to require synchronized changes compared to `Database.java` and `ParserDDL.java`.\n\nIn summary, the most significant candidate for synchronized modification with `SchemaManager.java` is `Database.java` due to its combination of high co-change frequency and tight coupling dependencies.

The coupling analysis revealed multiple instances where `SchemaManager.java` accesses or invokes methods and variables from `Database.java`.\n\n2. **ParserDDL.java**: Although this entity appears in the co-change history with `SchemaManager.java` (support: 2, confidence: 0.25), there are no direct coupling dependencies between them. Therefore, it is less critical but still worth considering for synchronization.\n\n3. **QuerySpecification.java**: Appears once in the co-change history with `SchemaManager.java`, indicating that it might be modified together, albeit with lower support and confidence.\n\n4. **BaseHashMap.java**, **StatementCommand.java**, **SchemaObjectSet.java**, **TestStoredProcedure.java**, **TestMerge.java**, **RangeVariableResolver.java**, **Schema.java**, **StatementDML.java**, **RowInputTextLog.java**, **RowStoreAVL.java**, **RowStoreAVLHybrid.java**, **DatabaseInformationFull.java**, **DatabaseInformationMain.java**, **IndexAVL.java**, **Cache.java**, **TransactionManagerCommon.java**, **JDBCArray.java**, **JDBCPreparedStatement.java**: These entities all have low support and confidence values (each appearing only once in the co-change history). They are included in the change set based on their co-change relationship but are less likely to require synchronized changes compared to `Database.java` and `ParserDDL.java`.\n\nIn summary, the most significant candidate for synchronized modification with `SchemaManager.java` is `Database.java` due to its combination of high co-change frequency and tight coupling dependencies.

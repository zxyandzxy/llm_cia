Moreover, despite there being no direct coupling dependencies between them, they have a strong conceptual coupling with a semantic similarity probability of approximately 0.819. Therefore, any changes to `DatabaseInformationFull.java` should likely be accompanied by changes to `DatabaseInformation.java`.\n\n2. **DatabaseInformationMain**: The co-change relationship between `DatabaseInformationFull.java` and `DatabaseInformationMain.java` is also significant, with 3 supports and a confidence value of 0.6. This suggests that when `DatabaseInformationFull.java` is changed, there's a good chance that `DatabaseInformationMain.java` will require changes as well.\n\n3. **ScriptWriterBase**: Although there are no direct coupling dependencies between `DatabaseInformationFull.java` and `ScriptWriterBase`, the latter has a co-change confidence of 0.5 with `FileUtil`, which is called by `DatabaseInformationFull.java`. Since `ScriptWriterBase` appears in the call graph of `DatabaseInformationFull.java`, it is reasonable to include it in the change set as a candidate for synchronization.\n\n4. **DataFileCache**: Similar to `ScriptWriterBase`, `DataFileCache` has a co-change confidence of 0.5 with `FileUtil`, which is called by `DatabaseInformationFull.java`. Additionally, `DataFileCache` is directly used by `DatabaseInformationFull.java`, making it another important candidate for synchronized changes.\n\n5. **FileUtil**: With a co-change confidence of 0.25 with `DatabaseInformationFull.java`, `FileUtil` has the lowest confidence among the listed entities. However, since it is directly called by `DatabaseInformationFull.java`, any changes in `DatabaseInformationFull.java` might necessitate corresponding adjustments in `FileUtil`.\n\nIn summary, these entities need to be considered for synchronized modifications when working with `DatabaseInformationFull.java` due to their co-change relationships, direct interactions, or conceptual coupling.

Moreover, despite there being no direct coupling dependencies between them, they have a strong conceptual coupling with a semantic similarity probability of approximately 0.819. Therefore, any changes to `DatabaseInformationFull.java` should likely be accompanied by changes to `DatabaseInformation.java`.\n\n2. **DatabaseInformationMain**: The co-change relationship between `DatabaseInformationFull.java` and `DatabaseInformationMain.java` is also significant, with 3 supports and a confidence value of 0.6. This suggests that when `DatabaseInformationFull.java` is changed, there's a good chance that `DatabaseInformationMain.java` will require changes as well.\n\n3. **ScriptWriterBase**: Although there are no direct coupling dependencies between `DatabaseInformationFull.java` and `ScriptWriterBase`, the latter has a co-change confidence of 0.5 with `FileUtil`, which is called by `DatabaseInformationFull.java`. Since `ScriptWriterBase` appears in the call graph of `DatabaseInformationFull.java`, it is reasonable to include it in the change set as a candidate for synchronization.\n\n4. **DataFileCache**: Similar to `ScriptWriterBase`, `DataFileCache` has a co-change confidence of 0.5 with `FileUtil`, which is called by `DatabaseInformationFull.java`. Additionally, `DataFileCache` is directly used by `DatabaseInformationFull.java`, making it another important candidate for synchronized changes.\n\n5. **FileUtil**: With a co-change confidence of 0.25 with `DatabaseInformationFull.java`, `FileUtil` has the lowest confidence among the listed entities. However, since it is directly called by `DatabaseInformationFull.java`, any changes in `DatabaseInformationFull.java` might necessitate corresponding adjustments in `FileUtil`.\n\nIn summary, these entities need to be considered for synchronized modifications when working with `DatabaseInformationFull.java` due to their co-change relationships, direct interactions, or conceptual coupling.

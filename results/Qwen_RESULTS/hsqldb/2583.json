The lack of explicit coupling or call information means we rely on co-change patterns here.\n\n3. **Expression**, **ExpressionOp**, **ParserDQL**: These entities each have 3 supports with a confidence of 0.2143. They may be conceptually related to `ArrayUtil.java` and could benefit from being checked when changes occur in `ArrayUtil.java`.\n\n4. **Table**, **IndexAVL**, **Cache**: Each of these entities has 2 supports with a confidence of 0.1428.

Although there were no coupling dependencies or call graphs found between them, their high conceptual coupling (0.817) suggests that they share related functionality.\n\n2. **LobManager**: This entity has 4 supports and a confidence of 0.2857, making it the second most likely candidate for synchronization. The lack of explicit coupling or call information means we rely on co-change patterns here.\n\n3. **Expression**, **ExpressionOp**, **ParserDQL**: These entities each have 3 supports with a confidence of 0.2143. They may be conceptually related to `ArrayUtil.java` and could benefit from being checked when changes occur in `ArrayUtil.java`.\n\n4. **Table**, **IndexAVL**, **Cache**: Each of these entities has 2 supports with a confidence of 0.1428.

Their inclusion in the change set is based on the possibility that they may share some common context or dependency with `ArrayUtil.java`.\n\nPlease note that while the co-change relationship indicates a historical pattern of joint modifications, it does not guarantee that changes will always propagate between these files.

In order to help solve the CIA mission, you should first understand some necessary concepts\uff1a\n(1)entity: Entities represent source code files in CIA tasks, and all the CIA tasks under study are based on the Java language, so entities are files with the .java extension.\n(2)starting entity: The starting entity is also called salient entity, and the salient entity is the root change that causes the modification of the rest of entities in a change set, while the rest of entities are the dependency modification along with the salient one.\nYou will be presented with a starting entity and tools (functions) will be provided to access the more information of the origin system. Your task is to gradually explain which entity really need to be synchronized, based on the starting entity and the information obtained through the function-call. You have 7 chances to call the function to get more information."

However, given their historical co-change patterns, they may still need to be reviewed during a change in `Tokens.java` to ensure that any indirect impacts are considered.\n\nAt this point, it would be beneficial to use the `get_conceptual_coupling` function to determine if there is any semantic similarity or conceptual coupling between `Tokens.java` and one of the top co-changed entities, which might explain why they tend to change together. Let's check the conceptual coupling between `Tokens.java` and `ParserDQL.java`.",

This suggests that despite the lack of direct technical dependencies (such as method calls or inheritance), these two entities are semantically related. They likely share common concepts or functionalities within the application's logic, which explains their historical co-change pattern.\n\nGiven this information, it is reasonable to conclude that changes in `Tokens.java` should prompt a review of `ParserDQL.java`, even if there are no explicit code-level dependencies. The high conceptual coupling implies that modifications in one might affect the other due to shared underlying logic or data handling practices.\n\nSince we have exhausted our available function calls but still have some understanding gaps regarding the exact nature of the relationships between `Tokens.java` and other co-changed entities, the next steps for further analysis would typically involve:\n\n1. Reviewing the source code of `Tokens.java` and `ParserDQL.java` to understand the shared concepts or functionalities.\n2. Examining the project's commit history to see specific instances where both files were modified together and why.\n3. Conducting interviews with developers who have worked on these parts of the codebase to gain insights into the design decisions and evolution of these components.\n\nFor now, based on the analysis conducted, `ParserDQL.java` should be considered for synchronization when `Tokens.java` is changed due to their strong conceptual coupling.

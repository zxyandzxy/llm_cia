Although there are no direct coupling dependencies between them, they have a strong conceptual coupling probability of 0.843. This indicates that changes to `TextCache.java` are likely to necessitate corresponding changes in `TextTable.java` due to their close functional relationship.\n\n2. **RowStoreAVLDiskData.java**: With 4 supports and a confidence level of 0.5, this entity also shows a significant co-change relationship with `TextCache.java`. It shares an even stronger conceptual coupling probability of 0.850. Changes in `TextCache.java` could require adjustments in `RowStoreAVLDiskData.java` to maintain consistency across related functionalities.\n\n3. **DataFileCache.java**: This entity appears with 3 supports and a confidence level of 0.375. While not as strongly correlated as the top two, it still exhibits a notable connection through co-changes. Given its relevance within the system's caching mechanisms, it should be reviewed for potential changes when modifying `TextCache.java`.\n\n4. **Cache.java**: With 2 supports and a confidence level of 0.25, this entity is linked to `TextCache.java` and may need synchronization based on the shared functionality related to caching. Its presence in the list suggests a possible impact from changes made to `TextCache.java`.\n\n5. **Log.java**: Having 2 supports and a confidence level of 0.25, this logging utility might need updates if the logging behavior or requirements change as part of modifications to `TextCache.java`.\n\n6. **SchemaManager.java**: This entity appears once in the co-change history with `TextCache.java`, but given its central role in managing database schema, any structural changes affecting `TextCache.java` could also influence `SchemaManager.java`.\n\n7. **Trace.java**: Similar to `Log.java`, `Trace.java` is included due to its single appearance in the co-change history with `TextCache.java`. It's important for tracing purposes and might require changes alongside `TextCache.java` to ensure proper debugging and logging capabilities are maintained.\n\nEach of these entities plays a role in different aspects of the system's operation closely tied to the functions provided by `TextCache.java`.

Although there are no direct coupling dependencies between them, they have a strong conceptual coupling probability of 0.843. This indicates that changes to `TextCache.java` are likely to necessitate corresponding changes in `TextTable.java` due to their close functional relationship.\n\n2. **RowStoreAVLDiskData.java**: With 4 supports and a confidence level of 0.5, this entity also shows a significant co-change relationship with `TextCache.java`. It shares an even stronger conceptual coupling probability of 0.850. Changes in `TextCache.java` could require adjustments in `RowStoreAVLDiskData.java` to maintain consistency across related functionalities.\n\n3. **DataFileCache.java**: This entity appears with 3 supports and a confidence level of 0.375. While not as strongly correlated as the top two, it still exhibits a notable connection through co-changes. Given its relevance within the system's caching mechanisms, it should be reviewed for potential changes when modifying `TextCache.java`.\n\n4. **Cache.java**: With 2 supports and a confidence level of 0.25, this entity is linked to `TextCache.java` and may need synchronization based on the shared functionality related to caching. Its presence in the list suggests a possible impact from changes made to `TextCache.java`.\n\n5. **Log.java**: Having 2 supports and a confidence level of 0.25, this logging utility might need updates if the logging behavior or requirements change as part of modifications to `TextCache.java`.\n\n6. **SchemaManager.java**: This entity appears once in the co-change history with `TextCache.java`, but given its central role in managing database schema, any structural changes affecting `TextCache.java` could also influence `SchemaManager.java`.\n\n7. **Trace.java**: Similar to `Log.java`, `Trace.java` is included due to its single appearance in the co-change history with `TextCache.java`. It's important for tracing purposes and might require changes alongside `TextCache.java` to ensure proper debugging and logging capabilities are maintained.\n\nEach of these entities plays a role in different aspects of the system's operation closely tied to the functions provided by `TextCache.java`.

Although there are no direct coupling dependencies, they might share common functionality or be affected by similar architectural changes.\n\n2. **IntervalType**: Similar to NumberType, this entity also has a support count of 2 and a confidence level of 0.2857142857142857. It is likely that changes to `CharacterType.java` could necessitate changes here due to shared requirements or design patterns.\n\n3. **DateTimeType**: With the same support count and confidence as NumberType and IntervalType, this entity should be considered for synchronized modification. The lack of direct coupling does not rule out the need for change coordination.\n\n4. **BinaryType**: Also having a support count of 2 and a confidence level of 0.2857142857142857, this entity might require changes in conjunction with `CharacterType.java`.\n\n5. **DatabaseInformationMain**: This entity shares the same support count and confidence level as the above types and should be reviewed for potential changes when `CharacterType.java` is modified.\n\n6. **DatabaseInformationFull**: Like DatabaseInformationMain, it shows a tendency to co-change with `CharacterType.java` and should be included in the change synchronization process.\n\n7. **JDBCResultSetMetaData**: This entity appears in the co-change list with a lower support count of 1 and a confidence level of 0.14285714285714285. While less likely to require changes, it still shows some correlation and should be monitored.\n\n8. **StatementDML**: Similarly to JDBCResultSetMetaData, it has a lower support count and confidence level but may still benefit from being checked during modifications to `CharacterType.java`.\n\n9. **ParserDQL**: With a single support instance and low confidence, this entity has a minor correlation with `CharacterType.java` but should not be ignored entirely.\n\n10. **RangeVariableResolver**: Also showing a low support count and confidence, this entity should be considered if there's any indication that the changes affect related areas of the system.\n\n11. **LobStoreRAFile**: This entity has a low support count and confidence, suggesting it might occasionally change with `CharacterType.java`, but the necessity for synchronization is less clear.\n\n12. **RAShadowFile**: Similar to LobStoreRAFile, this entity should be considered in case of any significant changes to `CharacterType.java`.\n\n13. **RowSetNavigatorDataChange**: Having the lowest support count and confidence among the entities listed, this entity is the least likely to require synchronization but is included for completeness.\n\nIn conclusion, while direct coupling dependencies were not found between `CharacterType.java` and the entities in the change set, historical co-change patterns suggest that these entities should be reviewed and potentially modified together to ensure consistency and avoid potential issues.

Although there are no direct coupling dependencies, they might share common functionality or be affected by similar architectural changes.\n\n2. **IntervalType**: Similar to NumberType, this entity also has a support count of 2 and a confidence level of 0.2857142857142857. It is likely that changes to `CharacterType.java` could necessitate changes here due to shared requirements or design patterns.\n\n3. **DateTimeType**: With the same support count and confidence as NumberType and IntervalType, this entity should be considered for synchronized modification. The lack of direct coupling does not rule out the need for change coordination.\n\n4. **BinaryType**: Also having a support count of 2 and a confidence level of 0.2857142857142857, this entity might require changes in conjunction with `CharacterType.java`.\n\n5. **DatabaseInformationMain**: This entity shares the same support count and confidence level as the above types and should be reviewed for potential changes when `CharacterType.java` is modified.\n\n6. **DatabaseInformationFull**: Like DatabaseInformationMain, it shows a tendency to co-change with `CharacterType.java` and should be included in the change synchronization process.\n\n7. **JDBCResultSetMetaData**: This entity appears in the co-change list with a lower support count of 1 and a confidence level of 0.14285714285714285. While less likely to require changes, it still shows some correlation and should be monitored.\n\n8. **StatementDML**: Similarly to JDBCResultSetMetaData, it has a lower support count and confidence level but may still benefit from being checked during modifications to `CharacterType.java`.\n\n9. **ParserDQL**: With a single support instance and low confidence, this entity has a minor correlation with `CharacterType.java` but should not be ignored entirely.\n\n10. **RangeVariableResolver**: Also showing a low support count and confidence, this entity should be considered if there's any indication that the changes affect related areas of the system.\n\n11. **LobStoreRAFile**: This entity has a low support count and confidence, suggesting it might occasionally change with `CharacterType.java`, but the necessity for synchronization is less clear.\n\n12. **RAShadowFile**: Similar to LobStoreRAFile, this entity should be considered in case of any significant changes to `CharacterType.java`.\n\n13. **RowSetNavigatorDataChange**: Having the lowest support count and confidence among the entities listed, this entity is the least likely to require synchronization but is included for completeness.\n\nIn conclusion, while direct coupling dependencies were not found between `CharacterType.java` and the entities in the change set, historical co-change patterns suggest that these entities should be reviewed and potentially modified together to ensure consistency and avoid potential issues.

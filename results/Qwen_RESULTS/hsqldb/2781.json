In order to help solve the CIA mission, you should first understand some necessary concepts\uff1a\n(1)entity: Entities represent source code files in CIA tasks, and all the CIA tasks under study are based on the Java language, so entities are files with the .java extension.\n(2)starting entity: The starting entity is also called salient entity, and the salient entity is the root change that causes the modification of the rest of entities in a change set, while the rest of entities are the dependency modification along with the salient one.\nYou will be presented with a starting entity and tools (functions) will be provided to access the more information of the origin system. Your task is to gradually explain which entity really need to be synchronized, based on the starting entity and the information obtained through the function-call. You have 7 chances to call the function to get more information."

Furthermore, multiple coupling dependencies were identified between these two entities, such as Return Type, Method Member Variable Usage Variable, and Function Parameter Usage Variable. These indicate that changes to \"Expression.java\" are likely to impact \"Select.java\", necessitating synchronized modifications.\n\n2. **ParserDQL**: Although no direct coupling dependencies were found, it shares a significant co-change relationship with \"Expression.java\" (supports: 10, confidence: 0.17), suggesting that changes to \"Expression.java\" might also require adjustments in \"ParserDQL.java\".\n\n3. **QuerySpecification**: Similar to \"ParserDQL.java\", there is a notable co-change relationship with \"Expression.java\" (supports: 10, confidence: 0.17) but without direct coupling dependencies. It's included due to its high support count.\n\n4. **Parser**: Despite the lack of coupling dependencies, \"Parser.java\" shows a very strong co-change relationship with \"Expression.java\" (supports: 20, confidence: 0.34). This suggests that changes to \"Expression.java\" may often coincide with changes to \"Parser.java\".\n\n5. **ExpressionLogical**: This entity has a relatively high number of supports (8, confidence: 0.14) and could be logically connected to \"Expression.java\". Though not analyzed for coupling dependencies here, it's prudent to consider it for synchronization.\n\n6. **ExpressionAggregate**: With 5 supports and a confidence of 0.08, this entity has been changed alongside \"Expression.java\" in the past. Considering the potential logical connection, it should be considered for synchronization.\n\n7. **ExpressionOp**: Having 3 supports and a confidence of 0.05, \"ExpressionOp.java\" is less strongly associated but still appears in the co-change history with \"Expression.java\".\n\n8. **ExpressionArithmetic**: It has 4 supports and a confidence of 0.07, indicating some degree of association through past changes.\n\n9. **ParserRoutine**: This entity has 5 supports and a confidence of 0.08, showing moderate evidence of co-changes.\n\n10. **ExpressionColumn**: There are 6 supports and a confidence of 0.10, making it another candidate for consideration.\n\n11. **FunctionSQLInvoked**: With 6 supports and a confidence of 0.10, this entity should be considered for potential synchronization.\n\n12. **RangeVariableResolver**: It has 5 supports and a confidence of 0.08, so it's included in the change set.\n\n13. **StatementDMQL**: This entity has 2 supports and a confidence of 0.03, but given its nature related to Data Manipulation and Query Language, it might be relevant.\n\n14. **StatementDML**: With 2 supports and a confidence of 0.03, it is included due to its relevance to DML operations.\n\n15. **StatementSimple**: Also with 2 supports and a confidence of 0.03, it is added to cover simple statements potentially affected by changes in expressions.\n\n16. **Table**: Finally, \"Table.java\" is included with 2 supports and a confidence of 0.03, as tables can be influenced by changes in expressions used within queries.\n\nPlease note that while all the entities listed have shown some level of co-change relationship with \"Expression.java\", only \"Select.java\" has demonstrated concrete coupling dependencies. The other entities are included based on their co-change frequency and logical connections inferred from their names and roles within the system.",

Furthermore, multiple coupling dependencies were identified between these two entities, such as Return Type, Method Member Variable Usage Variable, and Function Parameter Usage Variable. These indicate that changes to \"Expression.java\" are likely to impact \"Select.java\", necessitating synchronized modifications.\n\n2. **ParserDQL**: Although no direct coupling dependencies were found, it shares a significant co-change relationship with \"Expression.java\" (supports: 10, confidence: 0.17), suggesting that changes to \"Expression.java\" might also require adjustments in \"ParserDQL.java\".\n\n3. **QuerySpecification**: Similar to \"ParserDQL.java\", there is a notable co-change relationship with \"Expression.java\" (supports: 10, confidence: 0.17) but without direct coupling dependencies. It's included due to its high support count.\n\n4. **Parser**: Despite the lack of coupling dependencies, \"Parser.java\" shows a very strong co-change relationship with \"Expression.java\" (supports: 20, confidence: 0.34). This suggests that changes to \"Expression.java\" may often coincide with changes to \"Parser.java\".\n\n5. **ExpressionLogical**: This entity has a relatively high number of supports (8, confidence: 0.14) and could be logically connected to \"Expression.java\". Though not analyzed for coupling dependencies here, it's prudent to consider it for synchronization.\n\n6. **ExpressionAggregate**: With 5 supports and a confidence of 0.08, this entity has been changed alongside \"Expression.java\" in the past. Considering the potential logical connection, it should be considered for synchronization.\n\n7. **ExpressionOp**: Having 3 supports and a confidence of 0.05, \"ExpressionOp.java\" is less strongly associated but still appears in the co-change history with \"Expression.java\".\n\n8. **ExpressionArithmetic**: It has 4 supports and a confidence of 0.07, indicating some degree of association through past changes.\n\n9. **ParserRoutine**: This entity has 5 supports and a confidence of 0.08, showing moderate evidence of co-changes.\n\n10. **ExpressionColumn**: There are 6 supports and a confidence of 0.10, making it another candidate for consideration.\n\n11. **FunctionSQLInvoked**: With 6 supports and a confidence of 0.10, this entity should be considered for potential synchronization.\n\n12. **RangeVariableResolver**: It has 5 supports and a confidence of 0.08, so it's included in the change set.\n\n13. **StatementDMQL**: This entity has 2 supports and a confidence of 0.03, but given its nature related to Data Manipulation and Query Language, it might be relevant.\n\n14. **StatementDML**: With 2 supports and a confidence of 0.03, it is included due to its relevance to DML operations.\n\n15. **StatementSimple**: Also with 2 supports and a confidence of 0.03, it is added to cover simple statements potentially affected by changes in expressions.\n\n16. **Table**: Finally, \"Table.java\" is included with 2 supports and a confidence of 0.03, as tables can be influenced by changes in expressions used within queries.\n\nPlease note that while all the entities listed have shown some level of co-change relationship with \"Expression.java\", only \"Select.java\" has demonstrated concrete coupling dependencies.

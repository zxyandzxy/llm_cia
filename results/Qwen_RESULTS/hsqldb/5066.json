One possibility is that they share common concepts or themes within their responsibilities, even if they do not explicitly reference each other in the code.\n\nTo explore this idea, I will use the `get_conceptual_coupling` function to check the semantic similarity between `User.java` and one of the co-changed entities.

Additionally, the conceptual coupling score between `User.java` and `ParserDDL` is 0.821, indicating a high semantic similarity. Both pieces of evidence suggest that changes to `User.java` should be accompanied by a review of `ParserDDL` to ensure consistency.\n\n2. **StatementCommand**: With a confidence level of 0.75 in the co-change relationship and an even higher conceptual coupling score of 0.841, `StatementCommand` is closely aligned with `User.java` both historically and conceptually. Changes to `User.java` should prompt a careful review of `StatementCommand`.\n\n3. **ParserCommand**: This entity appears alongside `User.java` changes with a confidence level of 0.75. While we do not have specific information about its conceptual coupling, the frequent co-changes imply a potential need for synchronization when modifying `User.java`.\n\n4. **StatementTypes**: Although it only appeared once during past modifications of `User.java`, it has a confidence level of 0.25. Its inclusion here is based on historical co-change patterns but lacks further evidence from other analyses.\n\n5. **ParserDQL**: This entity shares a moderate confidence level (0.5) in co-change history with `User.java`. It may benefit from being reviewed together with `User.java` due to this connection.\n\n6. **GranteeManager**: Appearing with a low confidence level (0.25), `GranteeManager` is included in the change set primarily because of its historical co-change pattern with `User.java`.\n\n7. **UserManager**: Similar to `GranteeManager`, `UserManager` also has a low confidence level (0.25) in terms of co-change. However, given its name and relation to user management, it could still be relevant for review when changing `User.java`.\n\n8. **FunctionCustom**: Listed with a single support and a confidence level of 0.25, `FunctionCustom` might be indirectly related to `User.java` through shared functionality or context within the application.\n\n9. **DatabaseInformationMain**: With one instance of co-change and a confidence level of 0.25, `DatabaseInformationMain` is another entity to consider for review due to its historical association with `User.java`.\n\n10. **SchemaManager**: Despite having a single support and a confidence level of 0.25, `SchemaManager` may require attention when making changes to `User.java` as part of ensuring overall system consistency.\n\n11. **Session**: Another entity with a single support and a confidence level of 0.25, `Session` could be relevant due to its possible interaction with user-related data and operations.\n\n12. **UserTypeModifier**: Lastly, `UserTypeModifier` is included with a single support and a confidence level of 0.25. It may be pertinent in scenarios where modifications to user types or attributes affect how users are managed within the system.\n\nIn summary, entities such as `ParserDDL` and `StatementCommand` show strong evidence for requiring synchronized changes with `User.java`, while others like `GranteeManager`, `UserManager`, and `FunctionCustom` are listed more cautiously based on their historical co-change patterns. Reviewing these entities ensures thorough consideration of all potential ripple effects resulting from changes to `User.java`.",

Additionally, the conceptual coupling score between `User.java` and `ParserDDL` is 0.821, indicating a high semantic similarity. Both pieces of evidence suggest that changes to `User.java` should be accompanied by a review of `ParserDDL` to ensure consistency.\n\n2. **StatementCommand**: With a confidence level of 0.75 in the co-change relationship and an even higher conceptual coupling score of 0.841, `StatementCommand` is closely aligned with `User.java` both historically and conceptually. Changes to `User.java` should prompt a careful review of `StatementCommand`.\n\n3. **ParserCommand**: This entity appears alongside `User.java` changes with a confidence level of 0.75. While we do not have specific information about its conceptual coupling, the frequent co-changes imply a potential need for synchronization when modifying `User.java`.\n\n4. **StatementTypes**: Although it only appeared once during past modifications of `User.java`, it has a confidence level of 0.25. Its inclusion here is based on historical co-change patterns but lacks further evidence from other analyses.\n\n5. **ParserDQL**: This entity shares a moderate confidence level (0.5) in co-change history with `User.java`. It may benefit from being reviewed together with `User.java` due to this connection.\n\n6. **GranteeManager**: Appearing with a low confidence level (0.25), `GranteeManager` is included in the change set primarily because of its historical co-change pattern with `User.java`.\n\n7. **UserManager**: Similar to `GranteeManager`, `UserManager` also has a low confidence level (0.25) in terms of co-change. However, given its name and relation to user management, it could still be relevant for review when changing `User.java`.\n\n8. **FunctionCustom**: Listed with a single support and a confidence level of 0.25, `FunctionCustom` might be indirectly related to `User.java` through shared functionality or context within the application.\n\n9. **DatabaseInformationMain**: With one instance of co-change and a confidence level of 0.25, `DatabaseInformationMain` is another entity to consider for review due to its historical association with `User.java`.\n\n10. **SchemaManager**: Despite having a single support and a confidence level of 0.25, `SchemaManager` may require attention when making changes to `User.java` as part of ensuring overall system consistency.\n\n11. **Session**: Another entity with a single support and a confidence level of 0.25, `Session` could be relevant due to its possible interaction with user-related data and operations.\n\n12. **UserTypeModifier**: Lastly, `UserTypeModifier` is included with a single support and a confidence level of 0.25. It may be pertinent in scenarios where modifications to user types or attributes affect how users are managed within the system.\n\nIn summary, entities such as `ParserDDL` and `StatementCommand` show strong evidence for requiring synchronized changes with `User.java`, while others like `GranteeManager`, `UserManager`, and `FunctionCustom` are listed more cautiously based on their historical co-change patterns. Reviewing these entities ensures thorough consideration of all potential ripple effects resulting from changes to `User.java`.",

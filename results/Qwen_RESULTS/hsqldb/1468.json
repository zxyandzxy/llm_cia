In order to help solve the CIA mission, you should first understand some necessary concepts\uff1a\n(1)entity: Entities represent source code files in CIA tasks, and all the CIA tasks under study are based on the Java language, so entities are files with the .java extension.\n(2)starting entity: The starting entity is also called salient entity, and the salient entity is the root change that causes the modification of the rest of entities in a change set, while the rest of entities are the dependency modification along with the salient one.\nYou will be presented with a starting entity and tools (functions) will be provided to access the more information of the origin system. Your task is to gradually explain which entity really need to be synchronized, based on the starting entity and the information obtained through the function-call. You have 7 chances to call the function to get more information."

The coupling includes method member variable usage, constructor invoking, function parameter invoking method, and method member variable invoking method. Due to the extensive interaction between these two entities, changes in `DoubleIntIndex` will likely require corresponding changes in `TestHashStructures.java`, making it essential to synchronize.\n\n- **StopWatch**: Similar to `DoubleIntIndex`, there are direct couplings between `TestHashStructures.java` and `StopWatch`. These include method member variable usage, constructor invoking, and method member variable invoking method, primarily within the `testDoubleIntSpeed` method. As a result, modifications to `StopWatch` would necessitate changes to `TestHashStructures.java`.\n\n- **TestDataStructures**: Although there are no direct coupling dependencies between `TestHashStructures.java` and `TestDataStructures.java`, historical co-change data indicates that they have been modified together with a 100% confidence level. Therefore, changes in `TestHashStructures.java` might require concurrent changes in `TestDataStructures.java` to maintain consistency or accommodate new features.\n\n- **TestSelf**: Despite the absence of direct coupling dependencies, this entity has also been co-changed with `TestHashStructures.java` based on past change patterns. It suggests that changes to `TestHashStructures.java` could potentially impact `TestSelf.java`, requiring synchronized modifications.\n\n- **TestCacheSize**: Like `TestDataStructures` and `TestSelf`, this entity has a history of being co-changed with `TestHashStructures.java` without any apparent direct coupling.

The coupling includes method member variable usage, constructor invoking, function parameter invoking method, and method member variable invoking method. Due to the extensive interaction between these two entities, changes in `DoubleIntIndex` will likely require corresponding changes in `TestHashStructures.java`, making it essential to synchronize.\n\n- **StopWatch**: Similar to `DoubleIntIndex`, there are direct couplings between `TestHashStructures.java` and `StopWatch`. These include method member variable usage, constructor invoking, and method member variable invoking method, primarily within the `testDoubleIntSpeed` method. As a result, modifications to `StopWatch` would necessitate changes to `TestHashStructures.java`.\n\n- **TestDataStructures**: Although there are no direct coupling dependencies between `TestHashStructures.java` and `TestDataStructures.java`, historical co-change data indicates that they have been modified together with a 100% confidence level. Therefore, changes in `TestHashStructures.java` might require concurrent changes in `TestDataStructures.java` to maintain consistency or accommodate new features.\n\n- **TestSelf**: Despite the absence of direct coupling dependencies, this entity has also been co-changed with `TestHashStructures.java` based on past change patterns. It suggests that changes to `TestHashStructures.java` could potentially impact `TestSelf.java`, requiring synchronized modifications.\n\n- **TestCacheSize**: Like `TestDataStructures` and `TestSelf`, this entity has a history of being co-changed with `TestHashStructures.java` without any apparent direct coupling.

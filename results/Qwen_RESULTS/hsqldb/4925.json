Your task is to gradually explain which entity really need to be synchronized, based on the starting entity and the information obtained through the function-call.

This implies that changes in the implementation or interface of `PersistentStore.java` could affect `Table.java` through the inheritance hierarchy.\n\n- Similarly, between `PersistentStore.java` and `RowStoreAVL.java`, there is also an Interface Implementation (II) dependency where `RowStoreAVL` implements `PersistentStore`. Thus, changes to `PersistentStore.java` may necessitate adjustments in `RowStoreAVL.java`.\n\nGiven this information, it's clear that both `Table.java` and `RowStoreAVL.java` should be synchronized when making modifications to `PersistentStore.java` due to the direct interface implementation dependency.\n\nSince we still have function calls remaining, let's investigate another entity with a high confidence score: `TableWorks.java`.",

Furthermore, an Interface Implementation (II) dependency was found where `RowStore` implements `PersistentStore`, indicating that changes to `PersistentStore.java` may necessitate changes to `Table.java`.\n\n2. **RowStoreAVL.java**: Also with 6 supports and a confidence score of 0.75, this file shares the same Interface Implementation (II) dependency with `PersistentStore.java`. Thus, any modifications in `PersistentStore.java` could impact `RowStoreAVL.java` due to their implementation relationship.\n\n3. **TableBase.java**: It has 5 supports and a confidence score of 0.625. Although no coupling dependencies were found between `TableBase.java` and `PersistentStore.java`, its frequent co-changes indicate potential indirect dependencies or common areas of change that might require synchronization.\n\n4. **TextCache.java**: This file has been changed alongside `PersistentStore.java` twice, with a confidence score of 0.25. While there is no direct coupling dependency identified, its repeated co-change suggests some level of dependency that should be considered for synchronization.\n\n5. **RowStoreHybrid.java**: Co-changed once with `PersistentStore.java`, having a confidence score of 0.125. Despite not having a clear coupling dependency, it's included due to its history of being modified concurrently with `PersistentStore.java`.\n\n6. **IndexRowIterator.java**: Similar to `RowStoreHybrid.java`, it also has one support and a confidence score of 0.125. Its inclusion in the change set is based on past co-change patterns.\n\n7. **TransactionManagerMVCC.java**: With one support and a confidence score of 0.125, this file has been changed along with `PersistentStore.java` once. The rationale for including it is based on historical co-change data rather than direct code dependencies.\n\n8. **ExpressionLogical.java**: This file appears in the co-change list with two supports and a confidence score of 0.25. Its co-change pattern suggests a need for consideration during synchronization despite the lack of evident coupling dependencies.\n\n9. **StatementDML.java**: Included in the co-change list with one support and a confidence score of 0.125, it represents another candidate for synchronization based on its past co-change history with `PersistentStore.java`.\n\n10. **DatabaseInformationMain.java**: Lastly, this file has one support and a confidence score of 0.125. Its presence in the change set is primarily due to the observed co-change behavior with `PersistentStore.java`.\n\nIn summary, while `Table.java` and `RowStoreAVL.java` have explicit Interface Implementation dependencies with `PersistentStore.java`, other entities such as `TableBase.java`, `TextCache.java`, `RowStoreHybrid.java`, `IndexRowIterator.java`, `TransactionManagerMVCC.java`, `ExpressionLogical.java`, `StatementDML.java`, and `DatabaseInformationMain.java` are included in the change set based on their historical co-change patterns with `PersistentStore.java`.

Your task is to gradually explain which entity really need to be synchronized, based on the starting entity and the information obtained through the function-call.

Furthermore, an Interface Implementation (II) dependency was found where `RowStore` implements `PersistentStore`, indicating that changes to `PersistentStore.java` may necessitate changes to `Table.java`.\n\n2. **RowStoreAVL.java**: Also with 6 supports and a confidence score of 0.75, this file shares the same Interface Implementation (II) dependency with `PersistentStore.java`. Thus, any modifications in `PersistentStore.java` could impact `RowStoreAVL.java` due to their implementation relationship.\n\n3. **TableBase.java**: It has 5 supports and a confidence score of 0.625. Although no coupling dependencies were found between `TableBase.java` and `PersistentStore.java`, its frequent co-changes indicate potential indirect dependencies or common areas of change that might require synchronization.\n\n4. **TextCache.java**: This file has been changed alongside `PersistentStore.java` twice, with a confidence score of 0.25. While there is no direct coupling dependency identified, its repeated co-change suggests some level of dependency that should be considered for synchronization.\n\n5. **RowStoreHybrid.java**: Co-changed once with `PersistentStore.java`, having a confidence score of 0.125. Despite not having a clear coupling dependency, it's included due to its history of being modified concurrently with `PersistentStore.java`.\n\n6. **IndexRowIterator.java**: Similar to `RowStoreHybrid.java`, it also has one support and a confidence score of 0.125. Its inclusion in the change set is based on past co-change patterns.\n\n7. **TransactionManagerMVCC.java**: With one support and a confidence score of 0.125, this file has been changed along with `PersistentStore.java` once. The rationale for including it is based on historical co-change data rather than direct code dependencies.\n\n8. **ExpressionLogical.java**: This file appears in the co-change list with two supports and a confidence score of 0.25. Its co-change pattern suggests a need for consideration during synchronization despite the lack of evident coupling dependencies.\n\n9. **StatementDML.java**: Included in the co-change list with one support and a confidence score of 0.125, it represents another candidate for synchronization based on its past co-change history with `PersistentStore.java`.\n\n10. **DatabaseInformationMain.java**: Lastly, this file has one support and a confidence score of 0.125. Its presence in the change set is primarily due to the observed co-change behavior with `PersistentStore.java`.\n\nIn summary, while `Table.java` and `RowStoreAVL.java` have explicit Interface Implementation dependencies with `PersistentStore.java`, other entities such as `TableBase.java`, `TextCache.java`, `RowStoreHybrid.java`, `IndexRowIterator.java`, `TransactionManagerMVCC.java`, `ExpressionLogical.java`, `StatementDML.java`, and `DatabaseInformationMain.java` are included in the change set based on their historical co-change patterns with `PersistentStore.java`.

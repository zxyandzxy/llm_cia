The co-change relationship shows it has been changed together twice with a confidence level of 0.4.

While there is no additional information from other analyses, its co-change frequency suggests a moderate likelihood of needing synchronization when `RowStoreAVL.java` is modified.\n\n- **RowStoreAVLHybridExtended.java**: Similar to `RowStoreAVLHybrid.java`, this entity shares the same confidence level of 0.4 in the co-change history. It indicates a similar need for synchronization based on past change patterns.\n\n- **RowStoreAVLDisk.java**: This entity also shares the same confidence level of 0.4 in terms of co-change with `RowStoreAVL.java`. Its presence in the co-change list implies that it might require updates alongside `RowStoreAVL.java`.\n\n- **RowStoreAVLDiskData.java**: Like the above entities, this one has a confidence level of 0.4 and should be considered for potential synchronization due to the historical co-change pattern.\n\n- **NodeAVL.java**: Although `NodeAVL.java` does not have explicit coupling dependencies with `RowStoreAVL.java`, it is directly called within `RowStoreAVL.java`. This direct interaction means that changes in `RowStoreAVL.java` could indirectly affect `NodeAVL.java`. Therefore, it should be reviewed for possible synchronization despite the lack of coupling evidence.\n\nThe elements in the Change set are sorted in descending order of the likelihood of synchronized modifications. `IndexAVL.java` leads the list due to strong evidence from multiple analysis perspectives, followed by entities with moderate evidence from co-change relationships.

The co-change relationship shows it has been changed together twice with a confidence level of 0.4. Moreover, there are type casting coupling dependencies between these two entities and their conceptual coupling is quite high (semantic similarity probability of 0.828).

While there is no additional information from other analyses, its co-change frequency suggests a moderate likelihood of needing synchronization when `RowStoreAVL.java` is modified.\n\n- **RowStoreAVLHybridExtended.java**: Similar to `RowStoreAVLHybrid.java`, this entity shares the same confidence level of 0.4 in the co-change history. It indicates a similar need for synchronization based on past change patterns.\n\n- **RowStoreAVLDisk.java**: This entity also shares the same confidence level of 0.4 in terms of co-change with `RowStoreAVL.java`. Its presence in the co-change list implies that it might require updates alongside `RowStoreAVL.java`.\n\n- **RowStoreAVLDiskData.java**: Like the above entities, this one has a confidence level of 0.4 and should be considered for potential synchronization due to the historical co-change pattern.\n\n- **NodeAVL.java**: Although `NodeAVL.java` does not have explicit coupling dependencies with `RowStoreAVL.java`, it is directly called within `RowStoreAVL.java`. This direct interaction means that changes in `RowStoreAVL.java` could indirectly affect `NodeAVL.java`. Therefore, it should be reviewed for possible synchronization despite the lack of coupling evidence.\n\nThe elements in the Change set are sorted in descending order of the likelihood of synchronized modifications. `IndexAVL.java` leads the list due to strong evidence from multiple analysis perspectives, followed by entities with moderate evidence from co-change relationships.

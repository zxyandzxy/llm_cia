Considering our remaining function calls, we could look into other entities with notable co-changes using the `get_coupling_dependencies` function to see if there are any direct dependencies that might necessitate their synchronization as well. However, given the already strong evidence pointing towards `Parser.java`, it's likely that this entity will be the most critical one to update alongside `Token.java`.\n\nWould you like me to investigate further with the remaining function calls, or do you agree that focusing on `Parser.java` for synchronization is sufficient based on the gathered data?

This high degree of similarity further supports the idea that changes to `Token.java` may require corresponding changes to `Parser.java`.\n\nBased on the co-change history and the semantic relationship, it is evident that `Parser.java` should be synchronized when modifying `Token.java`. Considering our remaining function calls, we could look into other entities with notable co-changes using the `get_coupling_dependencies` function to see if there are any direct dependencies that might necessitate their synchronization as well. However, given the already strong evidence pointing towards `Parser.java`, it's likely that this entity will be the most critical one to update alongside `Token.java`.\n\nWould you like me to investigate further with the remaining function calls, or do you agree that focusing on `Parser.java` for synchronization is sufficient based on the gathered data? If further investigation is desired, the next logical step would be to check the coupling dependencies between `Token.java` and another highly ranked co-changed file from the previous list.

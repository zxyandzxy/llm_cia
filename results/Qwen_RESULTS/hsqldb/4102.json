Although there are no direct coupling dependencies, the high semantic similarity score of 0.833 suggests that these entities share similar concepts or functionalities within the codebase.\n\n2. **ErrorCode.java**: With a support count of 1 and a confidence level of 0.25, this entity is also identified as a potential candidate for synchronization.

While there is no evidence of coupling dependencies or conceptual similarities, their co-change history suggests some form of indirect relationship or shared functionality that requires them to be updated together.\n\nThe elements in the Change set are sorted in descending order of the likelihood of synchronized modifications, with `StatementSimple.java` being the most likely due to its higher support count and confidence level, followed by `ErrorCode.java`. The remaining entities are grouped based on their identical support counts and confidence levels. Since there is no further evidence of coupling or conceptual relationships, they follow in alphabetical order. \n\nIt is important to note that while these entities show a co-change pattern, the actual necessity for synchronization should be carefully evaluated based on the specific context and understanding of the project's structure and requirements.

Although there are no direct coupling dependencies, the high semantic similarity score of 0.833 suggests that these entities share similar concepts or functionalities within the codebase.\n\n2. **ErrorCode.java**: With a support count of 1 and a confidence level of 0.25, this entity is also identified as a potential candidate for synchronization.

While there is no evidence of coupling dependencies or conceptual similarities, their co-change history suggests some form of indirect relationship or shared functionality that requires them to be updated together.\n\nThe elements in the Change set are sorted in descending order of the likelihood of synchronized modifications, with `StatementSimple.java` being the most likely due to its higher support count and confidence level, followed by `ErrorCode.java`. The remaining entities are grouped based on their identical support counts and confidence levels. Since there is no further evidence of coupling or conceptual relationships, they follow in alphabetical order. \n\nIt is important to note that while these entities show a co-change pattern, the actual necessity for synchronization should be carefully evaluated based on the specific context and understanding of the project's structure and requirements. In practice, developers often look at more detailed information about the nature of changes and interactions between entities to make informed decisions about which files truly need to be synchronized.",

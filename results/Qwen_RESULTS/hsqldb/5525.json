In order to help solve the CIA mission, you should first understand some necessary concepts\uff1a\n(1)entity: Entities represent source code files in CIA tasks, and all the CIA tasks under study are based on the Java language, so entities are files with the .java extension.\n(2)starting entity: The starting entity is also called salient entity, and the salient entity is the root change that causes the modification of the rest of entities in a change set, while the rest of entities are the dependency modification along with the salient one.\nYou will be presented with a starting entity and tools (functions) will be provided to access the more information of the origin system. Your task is to gradually explain which entity really need to be synchronized, based on the starting entity and the information obtained through the function-call. You have 7 chances to call the function to get more information."

Therefore, it is crucial to synchronize changes between these two files whenever modifications are made to either one.\n\n- **Session.java**: Although the confidence level (0.357) is not as high as that for `ServerProperties.java`, `Session.java` still shows a moderate co-change frequency with `ArrayUtil.java`, which is directly used by `ServerConnection.java`. Given this pattern, it's reasonable to consider `Session.java` for synchronization when making changes to `ServerConnection.java`, especially if those changes involve interactions with sessions or any functionality related to `ArrayUtil.java`.\n\n- **LobManager.java**: With a confidence level of 0.286 and having been co-changed 4 times with `ArrayUtil.java`, `LobManager.java` is another candidate for synchronized modifications. It suggests that changes in `ArrayUtil.java` (which interacts with `ServerConnection.java`) may require corresponding changes in `LobManager.java`. Thus, it should be reviewed and potentially updated alongside `ServerConnection.java`.\n\nThe elements in the Change set are sorted in descending order of the likelihood of synchronized modifications based on the provided co-change relationships. The direct and strong relationship between `ServerConnection.java` and `ServerProperties.java` places it at the top of the list, followed by `Session.java` and `LobManager.java`, which have shown moderate co-change patterns with entities closely interacting with `ServerConnection.java`.",

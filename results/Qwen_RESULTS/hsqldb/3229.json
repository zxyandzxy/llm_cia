ParserRoutine.java:\n   - Co-change relationship with BitType.java: Similar to DoubleIntIndex.java, the `get_co_change_relationship` function returned a support count of 1 and confidence of 1.0, showing a consistent pattern of being changed alongside BitType.java.\n   - Conceptual coupling probability: The `get_conceptual_coupling` function returned a slightly lower but still significant semantic similarity probability of 0.809.

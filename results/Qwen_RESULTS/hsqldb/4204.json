This high similarity suggests that changes to `Statement.java` could likely affect `ResultMetaData`, and vice versa.\n\nBased on the information gathered so far, here's the summary of entities that should be considered for synchronized changes along with `Statement.java`:\n\n1. **Entities with direct coupling dependencies:**\n   - `StatementDMQL.java`: Inherits from `Statement.java`.\n   \n2. **Entities used by `Statement.java` (from call graph):**\n   - `ResultMetaData`: Strong conceptual coupling.\n   - `ResultProperties`\n   - `Result`\n   - `OrderedHashSet`\n\n3. **Entities with co-change relationships but no direct coupling dependencies:**\n   - `ParserCommand.java`: High co-change frequency, but no direct coupling found.\n\nGiven the limited number of function calls we can make, it would be reasonable to prioritize based on the strength of evidence for each entity needing synchronization. We have already identified a direct inheritance dependency with `StatementDMQL.java`, and a strong conceptual coupling with `ResultMetaData`. Both of these should definitely be included in the synchronized change set.\n\nThe remaining entities from the call graph (`ResultProperties`, `Result`, and `OrderedHashSet`) do not have additional evidence beyond their usage within `Statement.java`. However, since they are directly referenced or used by `Statement.java`, they should also be treated as candidates for synchronized changes.\n\nFinally, while `ParserCommand.java` showed a high co-change frequency, without further evidence of direct or conceptual coupling, its necessity for synchronization is less certain. If there is an opportunity to investigate further, it might be worthwhile to explore why this co-change pattern exists.\n\nIn conclusion, the entities that need to be synchronized with `Statement.java` are:\n- `StatementDMQL.java`\n- `ResultMetaData`\n- `ResultProperties`\n- `Result`\n- `OrderedHashSet`\n\nIf you want me to perform any more checks or if you have additional questions about these findings, please let me know!",

This high similarity suggests that changes to `Statement.java` could likely affect `ResultMetaData`, and vice versa.\n\nBased on the information gathered so far, here's the summary of entities that should be considered for synchronized changes along with `Statement.java`:\n\n1. **Entities with direct coupling dependencies:**\n   - `StatementDMQL.java`: Inherits from `Statement.java`.\n   \n2. **Entities used by `Statement.java` (from call graph):**\n   - `ResultMetaData`: Strong conceptual coupling.\n   - `ResultProperties`\n   - `Result`\n   - `OrderedHashSet`\n\n3. **Entities with co-change relationships but no direct coupling dependencies:**\n   - `ParserCommand.java`: High co-change frequency, but no direct coupling found.\n\nGiven the limited number of function calls we can make, it would be reasonable to prioritize based on the strength of evidence for each entity needing synchronization. We have already identified a direct inheritance dependency with `StatementDMQL.java`, and a strong conceptual coupling with `ResultMetaData`. Both of these should definitely be included in the synchronized change set.\n\nThe remaining entities from the call graph (`ResultProperties`, `Result`, and `OrderedHashSet`) do not have additional evidence beyond their usage within `Statement.java`. However, since they are directly referenced or used by `Statement.java`, they should also be treated as candidates for synchronized changes.\n\nFinally, while `ParserCommand.java` showed a high co-change frequency, without further evidence of direct or conceptual coupling, its necessity for synchronization is less certain. If there is an opportunity to investigate further, it might be worthwhile to explore why this co-change pattern exists.\n\nIn conclusion, the entities that need to be synchronized with `Statement.java` are:\n- `StatementDMQL.java`\n- `ResultMetaData`\n- `ResultProperties`\n- `Result`\n- `OrderedHashSet`\n\nIf you want me to perform any more checks or if you have additional questions about these findings, please let me know!",

This indicates a strong relationship.\n2. **ClientConnection**: Changed every time (with 5 supports) when `SessionInterface.java` was changed, giving it a confidence of 1.0 which means it always changes with `SessionInterface.java`.\n3. **TransactionManager** & **SessionData** & **JDBCPreparedStatement**: These entities have a confidence level of 0.4 each, indicating they change in 2 out of 5 modifications of `SessionInterface.java`.\n\nGiven these results, it's clear that `Session.java` and `ClientConnection.java` should be synchronized whenever there is a modification in `SessionInterface.java`. Other entities such as `TransactionManager.java`, `SessionData.java`, and `JDBCPreparedStatement.java` may also need to be considered for synchronization depending on the nature of the changes made to `SessionInterface.java`.\n\nNext, I will call `get_call_graph` on `SessionInterface.java` to see if any of these entities are directly called by `SessionInterface.java` or if `SessionInterface.java` references them.

It means that every time `SessionInterface.java` was changed, `ClientConnection.java` was also modified.

While its conceptual coupling wasn't directly measured, the co-change history indicates that it should be considered for potential synchronization.\n\n5. **SessionData.java**: Also having a confidence level of 0.4, this entity has been changed alongside `SessionInterface.java` in the past. It's included in the change set due to its historical connection, though its exact need for synchronization would depend on the specifics of the changes made.\n\n6. **TestStoredProcedure.java**: With a confidence level of 0.4, this entity appears less frequently in co-changes with `SessionInterface.java`.

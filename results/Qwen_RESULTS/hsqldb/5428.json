In order to help solve the CIA mission, you should first understand some necessary concepts\uff1a\n(1)entity: Entities represent source code files in CIA tasks, and all the CIA tasks under study are based on the Java language, so entities are files with the .java extension.\n(2)starting entity: The starting entity is also called salient entity, and the salient entity is the root change that causes the modification of the rest of entities in a change set, while the rest of entities are the dependency modification along with the salient one.\nYou will be presented with a starting entity and tools (functions) will be provided to access the more information of the origin system. Your task is to gradually explain which entity really need to be synchronized, based on the starting entity and the information obtained through the function-call. You have 7 chances to call the function to get more information."

It shows a pattern of being changed together with `RowStoreAVL.java`.\n\n6. **TransactionManagerCommon**\n   - Co-change relationship: Confidence of 0.2.\n   \n   While the confidence is lower compared to others in the list, it still appears in the co-change results, suggesting some level of interdependence with `RowStoreAVL.java`.\n\n7. **PersistentStore**\n   - Co-change relationship: Confidence of 0.2.\n   \n   This entity also has a low confidence level but is listed in the co-change results, implying that there might be a shared context where changes in one require changes in the other.\n\n8. **DataFileCache**\n   - Co-change relationship: Confidence of 0.2.\n   \n   Like `TransactionManagerCommon` and `PersistentStore`, it appears in the co-change list with a confidence of 0.2, indicating potential dependencies requiring synchronization during changes.\n\nThe elements in the Change set are sorted in descending order of the likelihood of synchronized modifications based on the confidence levels and additional analyses performed. Entities with higher confidence and more evidence of structural relationships (such as inheritance and type casting) are placed at the top of the list.",

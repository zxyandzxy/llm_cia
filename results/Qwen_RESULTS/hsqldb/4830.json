Moreover, the conceptual coupling between these two entities is high, with a similarity probability of 0.8524399. This suggests that they share significant semantic content and are likely to be modified together due to their functional relevance.\n\n2. **StatementDML.java**: Although this entity also shows a historical co-change relationship with `RowSetNavigatorDataChange.java` (Supports: 1, Confidence: 1.0), the conceptual coupling between them is lower than that of `StatementResultUpdate.java`, with a similarity probability of 0.7173147.

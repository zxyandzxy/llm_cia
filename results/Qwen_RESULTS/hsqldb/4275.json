Additionally, it shares a high conceptual coupling with a semantic similarity probability of approximately 0.861. Despite the lack of direct coupling dependencies, this indicates that both entities share common functionality or context within the codebase.\n\n2. **SortAndSlice**: It also shows significant co-change frequency with `RangeVariable.java`, appearing in 3 out of 8 modifications (Support: 3, Confidence: 0.375). Although we did not have the chance to check for direct coupling or conceptual coupling, its frequent appearance in change history suggests a need for synchronization when modifying `RangeVariable.java`.\n\n3. **ParserDQL**: Similar to the previous entities, `ParserDQL` was modified together with `RangeVariable.java` 3 times out of 8 modifications (Support: 3, Confidence: 0.375). The co-change pattern implies that changes in one might require corresponding adjustments in the other to maintain consistency and functionality.\n\n4. **RangeVariableJoined**: This entity appeared in 3 out of 8 modifications along with `RangeVariable.java` (Support: 3, Confidence: 0.375). Given the name similarity and the co-change frequency, it is likely that `RangeVariableJoined` is closely related to `RangeVariable.java` and should be considered for synchronized changes.\n\n5. **ExpressionColumn**: With 2 co-changes out of 8 modifications (Support: 2, Confidence: 0.25), `ExpressionColumn` has a lower but still notable co-change relationship with `RangeVariable.java`. Changes here may affect the behavior of `RangeVariable.java`, so it's prudent to consider synchronizing modifications.\n\n6. **QueryExpression**: Also having a Support of 2 and Confidence of 0.25, `QueryExpression` completes our list. While its co-change relationship is less strong compared to the top entities, its inclusion ensures a comprehensive approach to potential ripple effects from changes to `RangeVariable.java`.\n\nEach entity listed in the change set has shown historical evidence of being modified in conjunction with `RangeVariable.java`.

Additionally, it shares a high conceptual coupling with a semantic similarity probability of approximately 0.861. Despite the lack of direct coupling dependencies, this indicates that both entities share common functionality or context within the codebase.\n\n2. **SortAndSlice**: It also shows significant co-change frequency with `RangeVariable.java`, appearing in 3 out of 8 modifications (Support: 3, Confidence: 0.375). Although we did not have the chance to check for direct coupling or conceptual coupling, its frequent appearance in change history suggests a need for synchronization when modifying `RangeVariable.java`.\n\n3. **ParserDQL**: Similar to the previous entities, `ParserDQL` was modified together with `RangeVariable.java` 3 times out of 8 modifications (Support: 3, Confidence: 0.375). The co-change pattern implies that changes in one might require corresponding adjustments in the other to maintain consistency and functionality.\n\n4. **RangeVariableJoined**: This entity appeared in 3 out of 8 modifications along with `RangeVariable.java` (Support: 3, Confidence: 0.375). Given the name similarity and the co-change frequency, it is likely that `RangeVariableJoined` is closely related to `RangeVariable.java` and should be considered for synchronized changes.\n\n5. **ExpressionColumn**: With 2 co-changes out of 8 modifications (Support: 2, Confidence: 0.25), `ExpressionColumn` has a lower but still notable co-change relationship with `RangeVariable.java`. Changes here may affect the behavior of `RangeVariable.java`, so it's prudent to consider synchronizing modifications.\n\n6. **QueryExpression**: Also having a Support of 2 and Confidence of 0.25, `QueryExpression` completes our list. While its co-change relationship is less strong compared to the top entities, its inclusion ensures a comprehensive approach to potential ripple effects from changes to `RangeVariable.java`.\n\nEach entity listed in the change set has shown historical evidence of being modified in conjunction with `RangeVariable.java`.

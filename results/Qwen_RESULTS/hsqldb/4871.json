Changes to `Statement.java` directly impact `StatementDMQL` due to this parent-child class relationship. Therefore, it is the highest priority for synchronization.\n\n2. **StatementSimple**: With a confidence level of 0.4 and appearing in two out of five changes involving `Statement.java`, this entity might have some functional or structural dependency that requires it to be changed alongside `Statement.java`.\n\n3. **ParserDDL**: Although there are no direct coupling dependencies between `ParserDDL.java` and `Statement.java`, they have been changed together twice, giving a confidence level of 0.4. This suggests that changes may be related to shared functionality or feature updates rather than code interdependencies.\n\n4. **ParserCommand**: Similar to `StatementDMQL`, `ParserCommand` has appeared in three out of five changes with a confidence level of 0.6. Despite the lack of direct coupling dependencies, its high co-change frequency indicates a significant indirect relationship that could warrant attention during changes.\n\n5. **StatementDML**: This entity has shown up in two out of five changes with a confidence of 0.4. The absence of coupling dependencies suggests that any necessary synchronization is likely due to shared functionality or involvement in similar tasks.\n\n6. **StatementProcedure**: Like `StatementDML`, this entity also has a confidence level of 0.4, appearing in two out of five changes. It does not share direct coupling dependencies with `Statement.java`, but the historical co-changes imply potential relevance when modifying `Statement.java`.\n\nIn summary, `StatementDMQL` is the most critical entity to synchronize with `Statement.java` due to the direct inheritance relationship.

This suggests that changes may be related to shared functionality or feature updates rather than code interdependencies.\n\n4. **ParserCommand**: Similar to `StatementDMQL`, `ParserCommand` has appeared in three out of five changes with a confidence level of 0.6. Despite the lack of direct coupling dependencies, its high co-change frequency indicates a significant indirect relationship that could warrant attention during changes.\n\n5. **StatementDML**: This entity has shown up in two out of five changes with a confidence of 0.4. The absence of coupling dependencies suggests that any necessary synchronization is likely due to shared functionality or involvement in similar tasks.\n\n6. **StatementProcedure**: Like `StatementDML`, this entity also has a confidence level of 0.4, appearing in two out of five changes. It does not share direct coupling dependencies with `Statement.java`, but the historical co-changes imply potential relevance when modifying `Statement.java`.\n\nIn summary, `StatementDMQL` is the most critical entity to synchronize with `Statement.java` due to the direct inheritance relationship.

In order to help solve the CIA mission, you should first understand some necessary concepts\uff1a\n(1)entity: Entities represent source code files in CIA tasks, and all the CIA tasks under study are based on the Java language, so entities are files with the .java extension.\n(2)starting entity: The starting entity is also called salient entity, and the salient entity is the root change that causes the modification of the rest of entities in a change set, while the rest of entities are the dependency modification along with the salient one.\nYou will be presented with a starting entity and tools (functions) will be provided to access the more information of the origin system. Your task is to gradually explain which entity really need to be synchronized, based on the starting entity and the information obtained through the function-call. You have 7 chances to call the function to get more information."

Both entities likely work closely together within the parser component of the system.\n\n2. **DatabaseScript.java**: It appeared 3 times when \"Token.java\" was modified (confidence 0.273) and shares a very high conceptual relationship with a semantic similarity probability of 0.817. Despite no direct coupling dependencies, it is conceptually related to \"Token.java\".\n\n3. **Table.java**: With 3 co-occurrences during changes (confidence 0.273), this entity might be indirectly related to the operations involving \"Token.java\". Though there's no direct coupling or conceptual dependency detected, its frequent appearance suggests a potential need for synchronization.\n\n4. **Expression.java**: Appeared 3 times during changes (confidence 0.273). Its co-change frequency indicates that it could be involved in similar functional areas as \"Token.java\", making it a candidate for synchronized changes.\n\n5. **ScriptWriterText.java**: Co-changed 2 times (confidence 0.182). While the confidence is lower than the top four, its co-change history suggests a possible relation to scenarios where \"Token.java\" is modified.\n\n6. **Function.java**: Modified 2 times along with \"Token.java\" (confidence 0.182). The co-change frequency implies a potential connection that may require synchronized changes.\n\n7. **Session.java**: Also changed 2 times with \"Token.java\" (confidence 0.182). Given its role in managing database sessions, any change affecting tokens might also impact session handling.\n\n8. **ParserDQL.java & ParserDDL.java**: Both have been modified twice with \"Token.java\" (confidence 0.182). As part of the parser subsystem, these entities are likely to be affected by changes to \"Token.java\", which is fundamental to parsing SQL statements.\n\nEach of these entities, based on their co-change history and conceptual relationships, represents a varying degree of necessity for synchronized modification with \"Token.java\".

Additionally, it extends `Server` (Inheritance), making any changes to `Server.java` potentially impact `WebServer`.\n\n2. **WebServerConnection**: It has a support count of 4 and confidence of 0.4. The coupling analysis revealed that instances of `WebServerConnection` are created and used directly within `Server.java`, indicating strong dependencies.\n\n3. **jdbcDatabaseMetaData**: This entity appeared in co-changes with `Server.java` three times, with a confidence of 0.3. Although no direct dependency was found via call or coupling graphs, its repeated co-change suggests some level of interaction or shared functionality.\n\n4. **ServerThread**: It has a support count of 3 and a confidence of 0.3. There is no detailed coupling information provided, but its frequent appearance in co-changes implies it might be indirectly related to operations involving `Server.java`.\n\n5. **Session**: With a support count of 2 and confidence of 0.2, `Session` is another entity that often changes alongside `Server.java`. Its exact relationship might require further investigation, but the co-change pattern suggests a potential need for synchronization.\n\n6. **DatabaseManager**: Like `Session`, `DatabaseManager` also has a support count of 2 and confidence of 0.2. While there's no direct evidence of dependency, its frequent co-change with `Server.java` makes it a candidate for change synchronization.\n\n7. **HsqlProperties**: This entity has been changed together with `Server.java` twice (confidence 0.2). From the call graph, we know that `Server.java` uses `HsqlProperties`, indicating a direct dependency.\n\n8. **ServerConfiguration**: It appeared twice in co-changes with `Server.java`, with a confidence of 0.2. Considering its name and purpose, it's likely involved in configuring aspects of `Server.java`.\n\n9. **HsqlDatabaseProperties**: This entity shares a similar reasoning as `HsqlProperties`. Given its presence in the call graph and co-change history, it may need to be updated when `Server.java` is changed.\n\n10. **ScriptReaderText**: Although this entity has a lower support count (1) and confidence (0.1), it was included due to its appearance in the initial co-change results. Further inspection may be needed to confirm its relevance.\n\nEach of these entities either shows a strong co-change relationship with `Server.java` or has direct dependencies that make them candidates for synchronized changes.

Additionally, it extends `Server` (Inheritance), making any changes to `Server.java` potentially impact `WebServer`.\n\n2. **WebServerConnection**: It has a support count of 4 and confidence of 0.4. The coupling analysis revealed that instances of `WebServerConnection` are created and used directly within `Server.java`, indicating strong dependencies.\n\n3. **jdbcDatabaseMetaData**: This entity appeared in co-changes with `Server.java` three times, with a confidence of 0.3. Although no direct dependency was found via call or coupling graphs, its repeated co-change suggests some level of interaction or shared functionality.\n\n4. **ServerThread**: It has a support count of 3 and a confidence of 0.3. There is no detailed coupling information provided, but its frequent appearance in co-changes implies it might be indirectly related to operations involving `Server.java`.\n\n5. **Session**: With a support count of 2 and confidence of 0.2, `Session` is another entity that often changes alongside `Server.java`. Its exact relationship might require further investigation, but the co-change pattern suggests a potential need for synchronization.\n\n6. **DatabaseManager**: Like `Session`, `DatabaseManager` also has a support count of 2 and confidence of 0.2. While there's no direct evidence of dependency, its frequent co-change with `Server.java` makes it a candidate for change synchronization.\n\n7. **HsqlProperties**: This entity has been changed together with `Server.java` twice (confidence 0.2). From the call graph, we know that `Server.java` uses `HsqlProperties`, indicating a direct dependency.\n\n8. **ServerConfiguration**: It appeared twice in co-changes with `Server.java`, with a confidence of 0.2. Considering its name and purpose, it's likely involved in configuring aspects of `Server.java`.\n\n9. **HsqlDatabaseProperties**: This entity shares a similar reasoning as `HsqlProperties`. Given its presence in the call graph and co-change history, it may need to be updated when `Server.java` is changed.\n\n10. **ScriptReaderText**: Although this entity has a lower support count (1) and confidence (0.1), it was included due to its appearance in the initial co-change results. Further inspection may be needed to confirm its relevance.\n\nEach of these entities either shows a strong co-change relationship with `Server.java` or has direct dependencies that make them candidates for synchronized changes.

Your task is to gradually explain which entity really need to be synchronized, based on the starting entity and the information obtained through the function-call.

Specifically:\n\n- `Cache.java` constructs a new instance of `ObjectCacheHashMap` with a specified capacity.\n- Several methods in `Cache.java` (such as `size`, `get`, `put`, `release`, `cleanUp`, `saveAll`, and `clear`) depend on corresponding methods within `ObjectCacheHashMap`.\n\nGiven the significant number of dependencies, it is evident that changes to `Cache.java` may require corresponding changes in `ObjectCacheHashMap.java`, even though there is no strong co-change history.\n\nBased on our analysis so far, we have identified two entities that should be synchronized with changes to `Cache.java`:\n1. `DataFileCache.java` - due to high co-change relationship confidence and conceptual coupling.\n2. `ObjectCacheHashMap.java` - due to direct coupling dependencies.\n\nBefore concluding, let's review one last entity for potential synchronization based on its usage in `Cache.java`. Given the list from the call graph, `Trace.java` could be another candidate because logging or tracing functionalities are often tightly coupled with caching mechanisms. Let's check if there are any co-change relationships between `Cache.java` and `Trace.java`.",

Additionally, the conceptual coupling between these two entities is high (semantic similarity probability of approximately 0.854), indicating significant overlap in functionality. These factors suggest that changes to `Cache.java` are likely to necessitate corresponding modifications in `DataFileCache.java`.\n\n- **ObjectCacheHashMap.java**: Although there is no evidence of a co-change relationship, this entity has numerous direct method invocations and constructor usages within `Cache.java`. Given the tight coupling dependencies identified through the `get_coupling_dependencies` function, it's clear that changes to `Cache.java` will likely impact `ObjectCacheHashMap.java` as well. Therefore, `ObjectCacheHashMap.java` should be synchronized with any changes made to `Cache.java`.\n\nThe elements in the Change set are sorted in descending order of the likelihood of synchronized modifications based on the strength of their co-change relationships and coupling dependencies. Thus, `DataFileCache.java` takes precedence over `ObjectCacheHashMap.java` due to its stronger historical co-change relationship. However, both entities are crucial for ensuring that changes to `Cache.java` do not lead to inconsistencies or errors elsewhere in the project.",

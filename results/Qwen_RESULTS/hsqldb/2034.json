Additionally, it has a high conceptual similarity score (0.829). Although there are no direct coupling dependencies or call references, this strong historical co-change relationship and semantic similarity suggest that changes to `Types.java` will likely require corresponding changes to `Expression`.\n\n2. **DataFileCache**: It has been co-changed with `Types.java` twice, giving it a support of 2 and a confidence of 0.5. While there are no further details about its relationship, the co-change pattern suggests a moderate likelihood of needing synchronization.\n\n3. **jdbcConnection**: Co-changed once with `Types.java`, indicating a lower confidence (0.25) but still suggesting that there may be some shared functionality or context requiring synchronization when `Types.java` is modified.\n\n4. **Util**: Similarly to `jdbcConnection`, it was co-changed once with `Types.java`. The single occurrence doesn't provide much evidence, but inclusion is based on the possibility of shared functionality or context.\n\n5. **HsqlDateTime**, **Function**, **DatabaseScript**, **Select**, **ConnectionDialogCommon**, **DatabaseCommandInterpreter**, **NIOScaledRAFile**, **jdbcResultSetMetaData**, **jdbcParameterMetaData**, **DITypeInfo**, **TestStressInsert**: These entities were each co-changed only once with `Types.java`, resulting in a confidence level of 0.25. They are included due to their historical co-change relationship, which might indicate they share some dependency or context with `Types.java`.\n\nThe elements in the Change set are sorted in descending order of the likelihood of synchronized modifications, primarily considering the number of supports and confidence levels from the co-change relationship.

Additionally, it has a high conceptual similarity score (0.829). Although there are no direct coupling dependencies or call references, this strong historical co-change relationship and semantic similarity suggest that changes to `Types.java` will likely require corresponding changes to `Expression`.\n\n2. **DataFileCache**: It has been co-changed with `Types.java` twice, giving it a support of 2 and a confidence of 0.5. While there are no further details about its relationship, the co-change pattern suggests a moderate likelihood of needing synchronization.\n\n3. **jdbcConnection**: Co-changed once with `Types.java`, indicating a lower confidence (0.25) but still suggesting that there may be some shared functionality or context requiring synchronization when `Types.java` is modified.\n\n4. **Util**: Similarly to `jdbcConnection`, it was co-changed once with `Types.java`. The single occurrence doesn't provide much evidence, but inclusion is based on the possibility of shared functionality or context.\n\n5. **HsqlDateTime**, **Function**, **DatabaseScript**, **Select**, **ConnectionDialogCommon**, **DatabaseCommandInterpreter**, **NIOScaledRAFile**, **jdbcResultSetMetaData**, **jdbcParameterMetaData**, **DITypeInfo**, **TestStressInsert**: These entities were each co-changed only once with `Types.java`, resulting in a confidence level of 0.25. They are included due to their historical co-change relationship, which might indicate they share some dependency or context with `Types.java`.\n\nThe elements in the Change set are sorted in descending order of the likelihood of synchronized modifications, primarily considering the number of supports and confidence levels from the co-change relationship. Entities with higher support and confidence are more likely to need synchronization changes alongside `Types.java`.

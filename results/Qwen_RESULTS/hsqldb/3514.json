In order to help solve the CIA mission, you should first understand some necessary concepts\uff1a\n(1)entity: Entities represent source code files in CIA tasks, and all the CIA tasks under study are based on the Java language, so entities are files with the .java extension.\n(2)starting entity: The starting entity is also called salient entity, and the salient entity is the root change that causes the modification of the rest of entities in a change set, while the rest of entities are the dependency modification along with the salient one.\nYou will be presented with a starting entity and tools (functions) will be provided to access the more information of the origin system. Your task is to gradually explain which entity really need to be synchronized, based on the starting entity and the information obtained through the function-call. You have 7 chances to call the function to get more information."

However, the dependency here is not as strong as with `FunctionSQL.java`, because it primarily involves method calls on a parameter rather than direct usage or creation of new instances.

The method `newCustomFunction` returns an instance of `FunctionSQL`, instances of `FunctionSQL` are created and used directly within several methods, and there are multiple invocations of `FunctionSQL`'s member variables. These direct interactions mean that any significant changes to `FunctionCustom.java` will likely require corresponding changes to `FunctionSQL.java`.\n\n2. **Session.java**: Although the dependency is not as strong as with `FunctionSQL.java`, `Session.java` is frequently used within `FunctionCustom.java` through method calls on a `Session` parameter. Given the frequent interaction, especially within the `getValue` method where multiple session-related methods are invoked, it's important to review `Session.java` when changes occur in `FunctionCustom.java`.\n\n3. **ParserDQL.java**: There are no direct coupling dependencies between `FunctionCustom.java` and `ParserDQL.java`. However, they have been changed together once in the past, indicating a potential indirect relationship or historical context that might warrant a review during changes but not necessarily synchronization.\n\n4. **RoutineSchema.java**: Like `ParserDQL.java`, there are no direct coupling dependencies between `FunctionCustom.java` and `RoutineSchema.java`. The single co-change occurrence does not suggest a strong reason for these files to be synchronized during changes.\n\n5. **FunctionSQLInvoked.java**: Similar to `RoutineSchema.java` and `ParserDQL.java`, there are no coupling dependencies found between `FunctionCustom.java` and `FunctionSQLInvoked.java`. The co-change history suggests only a minor connection that may not necessitate synchronization.\n\n6. **ExpressionOp.java**: No coupling dependencies were found between `FunctionCustom.java` and `ExpressionOp.java`. The one-time co-change event does not imply a strong necessity for these two entities to be synchronized during modifications.\n\nIn conclusion, the primary focus should be on `FunctionSQL.java` and `Session.java` due to their significant coupling dependencies with `FunctionCustom.java`. While `ParserDQL.java`, `RoutineSchema.java`, `FunctionSQLInvoked.java`, and `ExpressionOp.java` have shown co-change relationships, the lack of direct code dependencies makes them lower priority for synchronization compared to the top two entities.",

                "content": "Title: Diagnosis of starting entity `FunctionCustom.java`\nChange set: [FunctionSQL.java, Session.java, ParserDQL.java, RoutineSchema.java, FunctionSQLInvoked.java, ExpressionOp.java]\n\nDetails:\nBased on the analysis performed using various functions to assess coupling dependencies and co-change relationships, here is the explanation for why each entity in the given change set may need to synchronize changes with `FunctionCustom.java`, sorted in descending order of the likelihood of synchronized modifications:\n\n1. **FunctionSQL.java**: This entity has strong coupling dependencies with `FunctionCustom.java`. The method `newCustomFunction` returns an instance of `FunctionSQL`, instances of `FunctionSQL` are created and used directly within several methods, and there are multiple invocations of `FunctionSQL`'s member variables. These direct interactions mean that any significant changes to `FunctionCustom.java` will likely require corresponding changes to `FunctionSQL.java`.\n\n2. **Session.java**: Although the dependency is not as strong as with `FunctionSQL.java`, `Session.java` is frequently used within `FunctionCustom.java` through method calls on a `Session` parameter. Given the frequent interaction, especially within the `getValue` method where multiple session-related methods are invoked, it's important to review `Session.java` when changes occur in `FunctionCustom.java`.\n\n3. **ParserDQL.java**: There are no direct coupling dependencies between `FunctionCustom.java` and `ParserDQL.java`. However, they have been changed together once in the past, indicating a potential indirect relationship or historical context that might warrant a review during changes but not necessarily synchronization.\n\n4. **RoutineSchema.java**: Like `ParserDQL.java`, there are no direct coupling dependencies between `FunctionCustom.java` and `RoutineSchema.java`. The single co-change occurrence does not suggest a strong reason for these files to be synchronized during changes.\n\n5. **FunctionSQLInvoked.java**: Similar to `RoutineSchema.java` and `ParserDQL.java`, there are no coupling dependencies found between `FunctionCustom.java` and `FunctionSQLInvoked.java`. The co-change history suggests only a minor connection that may not necessitate synchronization.\n\n6. **ExpressionOp.java**: No coupling dependencies were found between `FunctionCustom.java` and `ExpressionOp.java`. The one-time co-change event does not imply a strong necessity for these two entities to be synchronized during modifications.\n\nIn conclusion, the primary focus should be on `FunctionSQL.java` and `Session.java` due to their significant coupling dependencies with `FunctionCustom.java`. While `ParserDQL.java`, `RoutineSchema.java`, `FunctionSQLInvoked.java`, and `ExpressionOp.java` have shown co-change relationships, the lack of direct code dependencies makes them lower priority for synchronization compared to the top two entities.",

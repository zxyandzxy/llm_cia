Furthermore, it has a high conceptual coupling probability of approximately 0.828, indicating a strong semantic similarity or shared functionality with `FileUtil.java`. It is highly likely that changes to `FileUtil.java` will necessitate changes to `ScriptWriterBase.java`.\n\n2. **DataFileCache.java**: Similar to `ScriptWriterBase.java`, this entity also has a co-change relationship with `FileUtil.java` supported by 2 changes out of 4 total changes (confidence level of 0.5). However, since we were unable to check the conceptual coupling due to function call limitations, it is ranked second.

While they have lower confidence compared to the first two entities, they still share a history of being modified alongside `FileUtil.java`. Therefore, these entities should be reviewed for potential necessary changes when modifying `FileUtil.java`.\n\nIt's important to note that while these entities are listed based on their co-change frequency and confidence levels, actual dependencies and need for synchronization may require further investigation beyond what can be determined from the provided functions alone.

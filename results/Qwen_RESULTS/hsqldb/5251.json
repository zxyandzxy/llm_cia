Furthermore, the conceptual coupling between these two entities is quite high (0.812), indicating they are likely involved in similar functionality or design patterns. Although there are no direct structural dependencies, the historical pattern and semantic similarity suggest that changes to `SimpleStore.java` will often require corresponding changes to `FrameworkLogger`.\n\n2. ClientConnection: Similar to `FrameworkLogger`, `ClientConnection` has a strong co-change relationship with `SimpleStore.java`, supported by a confidence score of 1.0. The conceptual coupling is even higher at 0.824, further suggesting that `ClientConnection` shares a significant amount of functional or design overlap with `SimpleStore.java`. Thus, it is highly probable that modifications to `SimpleStore.java` will necessitate synchronized changes to `ClientConnection` to maintain consistency within the software system.\n\nThe elements in the Change set are sorted in descending order of the likelihood of synchronized modifications based on the provided data from the functions. Both `FrameworkLogger` and `ClientConnection` have the same confidence score for co-changes, but `ClientConnection` has a slightly higher conceptual coupling, which is why it is placed first in the change set.

Furthermore, the conceptual coupling between these two entities is quite high (0.812), indicating they are likely involved in similar functionality or design patterns.

ClientConnection: Similar to `FrameworkLogger`, `ClientConnection` has a strong co-change relationship with `SimpleStore.java`, supported by a confidence score of 1.0. The conceptual coupling is even higher at 0.824, further suggesting that `ClientConnection` shares a significant amount of functional or design overlap with `SimpleStore.java`.

Although no direct coupling dependencies were found, the high conceptual coupling suggests that these files are semantically related and part of the same or closely related feature sets.

Additionally, the conceptual coupling probability of 0.8279 suggests a strong semantic similarity between these two entities. This implies that they are likely involved in similar functionalities or features within the OmegaT project. Therefore, changes to `CoreEvents.java` should prompt a review of `MainWindowMenuHandler` for potential modifications.\n\n2. **ProjectFrame**: Similar to `MainWindowMenuHandler`, `ProjectFrame` has a co-change relationship with `CoreEvents.java` showing a support count of 1 and confidence level of 1.0. The conceptual coupling probability is slightly lower at 0.8226 but still indicates a strong semantic relationship. This suggests that both files are closely related in terms of their functionality or feature set. Hence, any changes made to `CoreEvents.java` should also lead to an examination of `ProjectFrame` to ensure that any necessary updates are made.\n\nBoth entities in the change set do not have direct coupling dependencies with `CoreEvents.java`, which means the need for synchronization arises from their involvement in similar or interconnected features rather than explicit code dependencies. Reviewing these entities when modifying `CoreEvents.java` will help maintain consistency and prevent potential issues due to interrelated changes. \n\nHere is the full result from the function `get_co_change_relationship`:\n```\n[[\"MainWindowMenuHandler\", \"1\", \"1.0\"], [\"ProjectFrame\", \"1\", \"1.0\"]]\n```",

Additionally, the conceptual coupling probability of 0.8279 suggests a strong semantic similarity between these two entities. This implies that they are likely involved in similar functionalities or features within the OmegaT project. Therefore, changes to `CoreEvents.java` should prompt a review of `MainWindowMenuHandler` for potential modifications.\n\n2. **ProjectFrame**: Similar to `MainWindowMenuHandler`, `ProjectFrame` has a co-change relationship with `CoreEvents.java` showing a support count of 1 and confidence level of 1.0. The conceptual coupling probability is slightly lower at 0.8226 but still indicates a strong semantic relationship. This suggests that both files are closely related in terms of their functionality or feature set. Hence, any changes made to `CoreEvents.java` should also lead to an examination of `ProjectFrame` to ensure that any necessary updates are made.\n\nBoth entities in the change set do not have direct coupling dependencies with `CoreEvents.java`, which means the need for synchronization arises from their involvement in similar or interconnected features rather than explicit code dependencies.

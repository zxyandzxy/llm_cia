It is likely that it shares some dependency with OConsts.java, potentially through shared constants or configurations used in the main window menu operations.\n\n3. **RealProject.java**: With a confidence level of 0.222, RealProject also shows a pattern of being modified together with OConsts.java. Given its role in project management within OmegaT, changes to constants in OConsts.java might affect how projects are handled.\n\n4. **TMXReader2.java**: TMXReader2 has been co-changed with OConsts.java twice (confidence of 0.222) and could rely on constants or configurations defined in OConsts.java for handling TMX file formats.\n\n5. **LicenseDialog.java**: LicenseDialog appears in the co-change list twice (confidence of 0.222). It's possible that licensing information or related constants from OConsts.java are utilized by this dialog.\n\n6. **FileUtil.java**: Co-changed twice (confidence of 0.222), FileUtil may depend on certain constants or utility functions provided by OConsts.java for file operations.\n\n7. **TransFrame.java**: With a confidence level of 0.222, TransFrame might need synchronization due to its reliance on constants or settings from OConsts.java related to translation frames.\n\n8. **CommandThread.java**: Appears twice in the co-change history (confidence of 0.222), indicating potential dependencies on constants or configurations from OConsts.java for command execution threads.\n\n9. **StringEntry.java**: Co-changed twice (confidence of 0.222), StringEntry could require updates if changes in OConsts.java affect string handling or storage mechanisms.\n\n10. **ProjectProperties.java**: Lastly, ProjectProperties has a confidence of 0.222 in the co-change history.

Additionally, there is a strong conceptual relationship with a semantic similarity probability of 0.731, suggesting that these two files share common functionality or configuration concerns.\n\n2. **MainWindowMenuHandler.java**: This entity appears in the co-change list twice (confidence of 0.222). It is likely that it shares some dependency with OConsts.java, potentially through shared constants or configurations used in the main window menu operations.\n\n3. **RealProject.java**: With a confidence level of 0.222, RealProject also shows a pattern of being modified together with OConsts.java. Given its role in project management within OmegaT, changes to constants in OConsts.java might affect how projects are handled.\n\n4. **TMXReader2.java**: TMXReader2 has been co-changed with OConsts.java twice (confidence of 0.222) and could rely on constants or configurations defined in OConsts.java for handling TMX file formats.\n\n5. **LicenseDialog.java**: LicenseDialog appears in the co-change list twice (confidence of 0.222). It's possible that licensing information or related constants from OConsts.java are utilized by this dialog.\n\n6. **FileUtil.java**: Co-changed twice (confidence of 0.222), FileUtil may depend on certain constants or utility functions provided by OConsts.java for file operations.\n\n7. **TransFrame.java**: With a confidence level of 0.222, TransFrame might need synchronization due to its reliance on constants or settings from OConsts.java related to translation frames.\n\n8. **CommandThread.java**: Appears twice in the co-change history (confidence of 0.222), indicating potential dependencies on constants or configurations from OConsts.java for command execution threads.\n\n9. **StringEntry.java**: Co-changed twice (confidence of 0.222), StringEntry could require updates if changes in OConsts.java affect string handling or storage mechanisms.\n\n10. **ProjectProperties.java**: Lastly, ProjectProperties has a confidence of 0.222 in the co-change history. As it deals with project properties, it may depend on constants or configurations defined in OConsts.java.\n\nIn summary, while direct code dependencies were not found, the historical co-change patterns and conceptual relationships suggest that these entities should be reviewed for potential impacts when changes are made to OConsts.java.

Every time `AbstractMyMemoryTranslate.java` was modified, `MyMemoryHumanTranslate.java` was also modified. It is highly likely that changes to `AbstractMyMemoryTranslate.java` will require corresponding changes to this entity.\n\n2. **MyMemoryMachineTranslate**: Similar to `MyMemoryHumanTranslate`, this entity also shares a direct co-change relationship with `AbstractMyMemoryTranslate.java` (support count: 2, confidence: 1.0), indicating a high likelihood of needing synchronization when changes occur.\n\n3. **Token**: This entity is directly used by `AbstractMyMemoryTranslate.java`. Although no co-change relationship was found between `Token.java` and `AbstractMyMemoryTranslate.java`, its direct usage suggests that any significant change might necessitate adjustments here as well.\n\n4. **StaticUtils** and **WordIterator**: These entities have a co-change relationship with `Token.java` (support count: 1, confidence: 1.0). Since `Token.java` is used by `AbstractMyMemoryTranslate.java`, changes to `AbstractMyMemoryTranslate.java` might indirectly affect these entities due to their connection with `Token.java`.\n\n5. **WikiGet**: This entity is directly used by `AbstractMyMemoryTranslate.java`. The co-change analysis revealed that it changes alongside `GoogleTranslate`, `Google2Translate`, and `ApertiumTranslate`, suggesting that changes to `AbstractMyMemoryTranslate.java` could have ripple effects requiring changes in `WikiGet.java` and its co-changed entities.\n\n6. **GoogleTranslate**, **Google2Translate**, and **ApertiumTranslate**: These entities share a co-change relationship with `WikiGet.java` (support count: 1, confidence: 1.0). Because `WikiGet.java` is used by `AbstractMyMemoryTranslate.java`, changes to the starting entity may propagate to these entities as well.\n\nIn conclusion, while some entities like `MyMemoryHumanTranslate` and `MyMemoryMachineTranslate` show a strong need for synchronized changes due to their direct co-change relationship with `AbstractMyMemoryTranslate.java`, others such as `StaticUtils`, `WordIterator`, `WikiGet`, `GoogleTranslate`, `Google2Translate`, and `ApertiumTranslate` are included because of indirect dependencies or co-change patterns. Careful consideration should be given to each of these entities when planning modifications to ensure all necessary updates are made to maintain system consistency.",

Every time `AbstractMyMemoryTranslate.java` was modified, `MyMemoryHumanTranslate.java` was also modified.

Although no co-change relationship was found between `Token.java` and `AbstractMyMemoryTranslate.java`, its direct usage suggests that any significant change might necessitate adjustments here as well.\n\n4. **StaticUtils** and **WordIterator**: These entities have a co-change relationship with `Token.java` (support count: 1, confidence: 1.0). Since `Token.java` is used by `AbstractMyMemoryTranslate.java`, changes to `AbstractMyMemoryTranslate.java` might indirectly affect these entities due to their connection with `Token.java`.\n\n5. **WikiGet**: This entity is directly used by `AbstractMyMemoryTranslate.java`. The co-change analysis revealed that it changes alongside `GoogleTranslate`, `Google2Translate`, and `ApertiumTranslate`, suggesting that changes to `AbstractMyMemoryTranslate.java` could have ripple effects requiring changes in `WikiGet.java` and its co-changed entities.\n\n6. **GoogleTranslate**, **Google2Translate**, and **ApertiumTranslate**: These entities share a co-change relationship with `WikiGet.java` (support count: 1, confidence: 1.0). Because `WikiGet.java` is used by `AbstractMyMemoryTranslate.java`, changes to the starting entity may propagate to these entities as well.\n\nIn conclusion, while some entities like `MyMemoryHumanTranslate` and `MyMemoryMachineTranslate` show a strong need for synchronized changes due to their direct co-change relationship with `AbstractMyMemoryTranslate.java`, others such as `StaticUtils`, `WordIterator`, `WikiGet`, `GoogleTranslate`, `Google2Translate`, and `ApertiumTranslate` are included because of indirect dependencies or co-change patterns. Careful consideration should be given to each of these entities when planning modifications to ensure all necessary updates are made to maintain system consistency.",

Therefore, it is highly likely that changes to `TextFilterTest.java` will require corresponding modifications in `ResourceBundleFilterTest`.\n\n2. **TextOptions & TextFilter**: Both these entities have direct call graph relationships with `TextFilterTest.java`. Since they use or reference methods from `TextFilterTest.java`, any change in `TextFilterTest.java` could directly affect their behavior, making it necessary to review and potentially update them as well.\n\n3. **TestFilterBase, POFilterTest, INIFilterTest, HTMLFilter2Test, XLIFFFilterTest, TMXReaderTest**: These entities have been co-changed with `TextFilterTest.java` in the past, though with lower confidence levels compared to `ResourceBundleFilterTest`. The co-change relationship suggests that there may be contextual reasons for their simultaneous modification.

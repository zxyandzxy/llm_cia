We have strong co-change relationships indicating that several entities are often changed together with `Core.java`.\n2. From the call graph, we identified direct dependencies from `Core.java` to `GlossaryTextArea`, `MainWindowMenuHandler`, and `TransTipsMarker`.\n3. The conceptual coupling between `Core.java` and `Main` reinforces the idea that changes in `Core.java` will likely require changes in `Main`.\n\nTherefore, it's prudent to include the following entities for synchronization when modifying `Core.java`:\n- `GlossaryTextArea`\n- `MainWindowMenuHandler`\n- `TransTipsMarker`\n- `Main`\n\nConsidering we have used up some function calls, and based on the evidence gathered, these entities should be prioritized for synchronization.

It is also directly called by `Core.java`, indicating a strong dependency relationship.\n\n2. **Main** (Support: 3, Confidence: 0.2143; Conceptual Coupling: 0.8202)\n   - The semantic similarity probability between `Core.java` and `Main` is very high, suggesting that they are closely related in functionality. Changes in `Core.java` are likely to necessitate changes in `Main`.\n\n3. **GlossaryTextArea** (Support: 3, Confidence: 0.2143)\n   - GlossaryTextArea appears in the call graph for `Core.java`, showing a direct usage relationship. Given the co-change history and the fact that it's used within `Core.java`, this entity should be considered for synchronization.\n\n4. **TransTipsMarker** (Support: 2, Confidence: 0.1429)\n   - Although the support and confidence are lower compared to the top three, TransTipsMarker is used by `Core.java` according to the call graph, which justifies including it in the change set.\n\n5. **MainWindowMenu** (Support: 3, Confidence: 0.2143)\n   - With moderate support and confidence, and being part of the main UI, changes in `Core.java` might impact this entity due to their functional interdependence.\n\n6. **PluginUtils** (Support: 2, Confidence: 0.1429)\n   - This utility class has been modified alongside `Core.java` multiple times, indicating some level of dependency or shared functionality.\n\n7. **CommentsTextArea** (Support: 2, Confidence: 0.1429)\n   - While not directly called by `Core.java`, its co-change frequency suggests it may need adjustments when changes occur in `Core.java`.\n\n8. **LanguageToolWrapper** (Support: 2, Confidence: 0.1429)\n   - Similar to CommentsTextArea, LanguageToolWrapper has a co-change history with `Core.java` and could require updates if Core's behavior changes.\n\n9. **EditorController** (Support: 1, Confidence: 0.0714)\n   - Though having lower support and confidence, EditorController is directly called by `Core.java`, making it relevant for potential synchronization.\n\n10. **IMarker** (Support: 1, Confidence: 0.0714)\n    - As an interface that is potentially implemented or referenced by `Core.java`, it could be impacted by changes in `Core.java`.\n\n11. **ProviderStorage** (Support: 1, Confidence: 0.0714)\n    - ProviderStorage rounds out our list based on co-change history, although its connection to `Core.java` isn't as strongly established as the others listed above.\n\nEach of these entities has shown either a direct relationship through calls from `Core.java`, a conceptual relationship, or a pattern of co-changes throughout the project's version history.

This indicates that these two files are semantically closely related, which further justifies the need to synchronize changes between them.\n\nBased on our analysis so far:\n\n1. We have strong co-change relationships indicating that several entities are often changed together with `Core.java`.\n2. From the call graph, we identified direct dependencies from `Core.java` to `GlossaryTextArea`, `MainWindowMenuHandler`, and `TransTipsMarker`.\n3. The conceptual coupling between `Core.java` and `Main` reinforces the idea that changes in `Core.java` will likely require changes in `Main`.\n\nTherefore, it's prudent to include the following entities for synchronization when modifying `Core.java`:\n- `GlossaryTextArea`\n- `MainWindowMenuHandler`\n- `TransTipsMarker`\n- `Main`\n\nConsidering we have used up some function calls, and based on the evidence gathered, these entities should be prioritized for synchronization. However, if we want to ensure completeness, we could use our remaining function calls to check for any additional coupling dependencies between `Core.java` and the other entities mentioned in the co-change list.

It is also directly called by `Core.java`, indicating a strong dependency relationship.\n\n2. **Main** (Support: 3, Confidence: 0.2143; Conceptual Coupling: 0.8202)\n   - The semantic similarity probability between `Core.java` and `Main` is very high, suggesting that they are closely related in functionality. Changes in `Core.java` are likely to necessitate changes in `Main`.\n\n3. **GlossaryTextArea** (Support: 3, Confidence: 0.2143)\n   - GlossaryTextArea appears in the call graph for `Core.java`, showing a direct usage relationship. Given the co-change history and the fact that it's used within `Core.java`, this entity should be considered for synchronization.\n\n4. **TransTipsMarker** (Support: 2, Confidence: 0.1429)\n   - Although the support and confidence are lower compared to the top three, TransTipsMarker is used by `Core.java` according to the call graph, which justifies including it in the change set.\n\n5. **MainWindowMenu** (Support: 3, Confidence: 0.2143)\n   - With moderate support and confidence, and being part of the main UI, changes in `Core.java` might impact this entity due to their functional interdependence.\n\n6. **PluginUtils** (Support: 2, Confidence: 0.1429)\n   - This utility class has been modified alongside `Core.java` multiple times, indicating some level of dependency or shared functionality.\n\n7. **CommentsTextArea** (Support: 2, Confidence: 0.1429)\n   - While not directly called by `Core.java`, its co-change frequency suggests it may need adjustments when changes occur in `Core.java`.\n\n8. **LanguageToolWrapper** (Support: 2, Confidence: 0.1429)\n   - Similar to CommentsTextArea, LanguageToolWrapper has a co-change history with `Core.java` and could require updates if Core's behavior changes.\n\n9. **EditorController** (Support: 1, Confidence: 0.0714)\n   - Though having lower support and confidence, EditorController is directly called by `Core.java`, making it relevant for potential synchronization.\n\n10. **IMarker** (Support: 1, Confidence: 0.0714)\n    - As an interface that is potentially implemented or referenced by `Core.java`, it could be impacted by changes in `Core.java`.\n\n11. **ProviderStorage** (Support: 1, Confidence: 0.0714)\n    - ProviderStorage rounds out our list based on co-change history, although its connection to `Core.java` isn't as strongly established as the others listed above.\n\nEach of these entities has shown either a direct relationship through calls from `Core.java`, a conceptual relationship, or a pattern of co-changes throughout the project's version history.

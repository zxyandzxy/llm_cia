Any changes to the methods or signatures within `IEditor` would necessitate corresponding adjustments in `EditorController` to maintain compatibility and functionality.\n\n2. **MainWindowMenuHandler.java**: With a co-change support of 13 out of 19 changes to `IEditor.java`, and a confidence level of approximately 0.684, this entity has been frequently modified alongside `IEditor`. Additionally, the conceptual coupling score of 0.784 suggests a significant semantic relationship. Changes in `IEditor` could imply related functional updates in `MainWindowMenuHandler`.\n\n3. **GlossaryTextAreaTest.java**: This test class has also shown a high co-change frequency with `IEditor.java`, having been changed together 13 times, with a confidence level of around 0.684. Although it is a test class, its frequent modification alongside `IEditor` suggests it may need to be updated to reflect any new behaviors or functionalities introduced by changes in `IEditor`.\n\n4. **MainWindowMenu.java**: It has a moderate co-change history with `IEditor.java`, being modified 8 times out of 19 changes to `IEditor`, with a confidence level of about 0.421. This indicates that there's a reasonable chance that changes to `IEditor` might affect the menu system, which could require updates to `MainWindowMenu`.\n\n5. **MainWindow.java**: Co-changed 4 times with `IEditor.java`, with a confidence level of around 0.211. While the co-change frequency is lower compared to other entities, given the central role of the main window in an application, changes to `IEditor` might still impact the overall UI flow managed by `MainWindow`.\n\n6. **SourceTextEntry**: Directly referenced by `IEditor.java`, indicating that any change affecting how entries are handled in `IEditor` would likely necessitate corresponding changes in `SourceTextEntry`.\n\n7. **Mark** and **EntryKey**: Both these entities are directly invoked or used by `IEditor.java`. Changes in the handling or management of text entries within `IEditor` would directly influence these classes, making them candidates for synchronization.\n\nIn conclusion, the listed entities should be considered for synchronized modifications when changes are made to `IEditor.java`, ordered based on the strength of their dependencies and historical co-change patterns.",

Any changes to the methods or signatures within `IEditor` would necessitate corresponding adjustments in `EditorController` to maintain compatibility and functionality.\n\n2. **MainWindowMenuHandler.java**: With a co-change support of 13 out of 19 changes to `IEditor.java`, and a confidence level of approximately 0.684, this entity has been frequently modified alongside `IEditor`. Additionally, the conceptual coupling score of 0.784 suggests a significant semantic relationship. Changes in `IEditor` could imply related functional updates in `MainWindowMenuHandler`.\n\n3. **GlossaryTextAreaTest.java**: This test class has also shown a high co-change frequency with `IEditor.java`, having been changed together 13 times, with a confidence level of around 0.684. Although it is a test class, its frequent modification alongside `IEditor` suggests it may need to be updated to reflect any new behaviors or functionalities introduced by changes in `IEditor`.\n\n4. **MainWindowMenu.java**: It has a moderate co-change history with `IEditor.java`, being modified 8 times out of 19 changes to `IEditor`, with a confidence level of about 0.421. This indicates that there's a reasonable chance that changes to `IEditor` might affect the menu system, which could require updates to `MainWindowMenu`.\n\n5. **MainWindow.java**: Co-changed 4 times with `IEditor.java`, with a confidence level of around 0.211. While the co-change frequency is lower compared to other entities, given the central role of the main window in an application, changes to `IEditor` might still impact the overall UI flow managed by `MainWindow`.\n\n6. **SourceTextEntry**: Directly referenced by `IEditor.java`, indicating that any change affecting how entries are handled in `IEditor` would likely necessitate corresponding changes in `SourceTextEntry`.\n\n7. **Mark** and **EntryKey**: Both these entities are directly invoked or used by `IEditor.java`. Changes in the handling or management of text entries within `IEditor` would directly influence these classes, making them candidates for synchronization.\n\nIn conclusion, the listed entities should be considered for synchronized modifications when changes are made to `IEditor.java`, ordered based on the strength of their dependencies and historical co-change patterns.",

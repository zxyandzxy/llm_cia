Although we did not perform further analysis on this entity, its co-change pattern indicates that modifications to `StaticUIUtils.java` could potentially impact this entity as well.\n\n- The remaining entities ([MatchesTextArea, GlossaryTextArea, DictionariesTextArea, MachineTranslateTextArea, MultipleTransPane, CommentsTextArea, SegmentBuilder, EditorTextArea3, TagValidationFrame, TitledTablePanel, SearchWindowController, MainWindowUI, OmegaTFileChooser, MainWindow, ScriptingWindow, ResourcesUtil, ProjectFilesList, SearchWindowForm, IssuesPanelController, IssuesPanel, ISegmentPropertiesView, SegmentPropertiesListCell, MultilineCellRenderer, SingleLineCellRenderer, StaticUIUtilsTest]) each have one support in the co-change relationship with `StaticUIUtils.java`. While their confidence values are lower than those of `AboutDialog` and `EntryListPane`, they still indicate a potential need for synchronized changes based on historical modification patterns.\n\nIn summary, the elements in the change set are sorted in descending order of the likelihood of synchronized modifications based on the number of supports and confidence values from the co-change relationship analysis.

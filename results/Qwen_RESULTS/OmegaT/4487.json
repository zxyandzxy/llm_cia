Additionally, there are direct dependencies where `SegmentBuilder` accesses several member variables of `EditorController`. Therefore, changes in `SegmentBuilder.java` are likely to necessitate changes in `EditorController.java`.\n  \n- **CalcMarkersThread**: With a confidence of 0.357 and support of 5, this entity has a significant likelihood of being changed alongside `SegmentBuilder.java`. The high support suggests that it is frequently modified together with `SegmentBuilder.java`.\n\n- **IMarker**: Although its confidence is relatively low (0.214), it appears three times in co-changes with `SegmentBuilder.java`, indicating a moderate need for synchronization.\n\n- **MarkerController**: Similar to `CalcMarkersThread`, it has a confidence of 0.357 and support of 5, suggesting that changes in `SegmentBuilder.java` might require corresponding changes here as well.\n\n- **TransTips, EditorUtils, EditorTextArea3**: Each of these entities has been changed two times in conjunction with `SegmentBuilder.java` and have a confidence of 0.143. They may need to be reviewed when modifying `SegmentBuilder.java`, although their dependency is less strong compared to the first four entities.\n\n- **EntryMarks, MatchesTextArea, RealProject, TransTipsMarker, WaveUnderline, SpellCheckerMarker, Styles, TagValidationOptionsDialog, Loader, Preferences, IEditorFilter, SearchFilter, ReplaceFilter, EmptyNoneTranslationPopup, SourceTextEntry, EntryListPane, LastSegmentManager, WorkflowOptionsDialog, PatternConsts, MarkInfo, TranslationUndoManager, EditorPopups**: These entities have lower support counts and confidence scores, indicating they are less likely to require synchronized modifications but should still be considered during code changes due to their past co-changes with `SegmentBuilder.java`.\n\nThe elements in the Change set are sorted in descending order of the likelihood of synchronized modifications based on the provided co-change relationships and logical analysis of coupling dependencies.

Additionally, there are direct dependencies where `SegmentBuilder` accesses several member variables of `EditorController`. Therefore, changes in `SegmentBuilder.java` are likely to necessitate changes in `EditorController.java`.\n  \n- **CalcMarkersThread**: With a confidence of 0.357 and support of 5, this entity has a significant likelihood of being changed alongside `SegmentBuilder.java`. The high support suggests that it is frequently modified together with `SegmentBuilder.java`.\n\n- **IMarker**: Although its confidence is relatively low (0.214), it appears three times in co-changes with `SegmentBuilder.java`, indicating a moderate need for synchronization.\n\n- **MarkerController**: Similar to `CalcMarkersThread`, it has a confidence of 0.357 and support of 5, suggesting that changes in `SegmentBuilder.java` might require corresponding changes here as well.\n\n- **TransTips, EditorUtils, EditorTextArea3**: Each of these entities has been changed two times in conjunction with `SegmentBuilder.java` and have a confidence of 0.143. They may need to be reviewed when modifying `SegmentBuilder.java`, although their dependency is less strong compared to the first four entities.\n\n- **EntryMarks, MatchesTextArea, RealProject, TransTipsMarker, WaveUnderline, SpellCheckerMarker, Styles, TagValidationOptionsDialog, Loader, Preferences, IEditorFilter, SearchFilter, ReplaceFilter, EmptyNoneTranslationPopup, SourceTextEntry, EntryListPane, LastSegmentManager, WorkflowOptionsDialog, PatternConsts, MarkInfo, TranslationUndoManager, EditorPopups**: These entities have lower support counts and confidence scores, indicating they are less likely to require synchronized modifications but should still be considered during code changes due to their past co-changes with `SegmentBuilder.java`.\n\nThe elements in the Change set are sorted in descending order of the likelihood of synchronized modifications based on the provided co-change relationships and logical analysis of coupling dependencies. Entities at the top of the list are more critical to consider for synchronization when making changes to `SegmentBuilder.java`.",

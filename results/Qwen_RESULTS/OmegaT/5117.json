The nature of its co-change pattern indicates possible interdependencies with OConsts.java.\n\n7. **CommandThread**: Having a support count of 2 and a confidence of 0.222, CommandThread is listed because it has been changed together with OConsts.java, which implies that there could be shared logic or settings impacting both entities.\n\n8. **TransFrame**: Also having a support count of 2 and a confidence of 0.222, TransFrame is included in the change set due to its historical co-modification pattern with OConsts.java.\n\n9. **LicenseDialog**: With a support count of 2 and a confidence of 0.222, LicenseDialog is part of the change set, as it has been frequently changed alongside OConsts.java.\n\n10. **MainWindowMenu**: Similar to other entities in this list, MainWindowMenu has been co-changed twice with a confidence of 0.222, making it a candidate for synchronization efforts.\n\n11. **ProjectProperties**: This entity has a support count of 2 and a confidence of 0.222, implying that it might need to be updated when changes occur in OConsts.java.\n\n12. **ProjectFileStorage**: With a support count of 1 and a confidence of 0.111, this entity has less evidence for co-change but is still included given its connection with project-related properties that may relate to OConsts.java.\n\n13. **ProjectPropertiesDialog**: Another entity with a support count of 1 and a confidence of 0.111, it's included in the change set based on its co-change history with OConsts.java.\n\n14. **HelpFrame**: Lastly, with a support count of 1 and a confidence of 0.111, HelpFrame is added to the change set due to its past association with OConsts.java.\n\nAll these entities have been identified through their co-change relationships with OConsts.java and should be reviewed for necessary synchronized modifications to ensure system consistency and integrity.",

Although no explicit coupling dependencies were found, its co-change frequency suggests that it should be considered for synchronization.\n\n3. **TMXReader2**: Like MainWindowMenuHandler, this entity also shares a support count of 2 and a confidence of 0.222. It's included due to its history of being changed together with OConsts.java, hinting at potential shared functionality or requirements.\n\n4. **RealProject**: This entity has been co-changed with OConsts.java twice, with a confidence of 0.222. It might have related functionality or configurations that require concurrent updates when OConsts.java is modified.\n\n5. **FileUtil**: Co-changed with OConsts.java twice, with a confidence of 0.222, suggesting that it could be dependent on constants or configurations defined within OConsts.java.\n\n6. **StringEntry**: With a support count of 2 and a confidence of 0.222, StringEntry appears to be another candidate for synchronization. The nature of its co-change pattern indicates possible interdependencies with OConsts.java.\n\n7. **CommandThread**: Having a support count of 2 and a confidence of 0.222, CommandThread is listed because it has been changed together with OConsts.java, which implies that there could be shared logic or settings impacting both entities.\n\n8. **TransFrame**: Also having a support count of 2 and a confidence of 0.222, TransFrame is included in the change set due to its historical co-modification pattern with OConsts.java.\n\n9. **LicenseDialog**: With a support count of 2 and a confidence of 0.222, LicenseDialog is part of the change set, as it has been frequently changed alongside OConsts.java.\n\n10. **MainWindowMenu**: Similar to other entities in this list, MainWindowMenu has been co-changed twice with a confidence of 0.222, making it a candidate for synchronization efforts.\n\n11. **ProjectProperties**: This entity has a support count of 2 and a confidence of 0.222, implying that it might need to be updated when changes occur in OConsts.java.\n\n12. **ProjectFileStorage**: With a support count of 1 and a confidence of 0.111, this entity has less evidence for co-change but is still included given its connection with project-related properties that may relate to OConsts.java.\n\n13. **ProjectPropertiesDialog**: Another entity with a support count of 1 and a confidence of 0.111, it's included in the change set based on its co-change history with OConsts.java.\n\n14. **HelpFrame**: Lastly, with a support count of 1 and a confidence of 0.111, HelpFrame is added to the change set due to its past association with OConsts.java.\n\nAll these entities have been identified through their co-change relationships with OConsts.java and should be reviewed for necessary synchronized modifications to ensure system consistency and integrity.",

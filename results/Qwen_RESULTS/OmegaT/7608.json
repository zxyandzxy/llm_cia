Moreover, it has a high semantic similarity probability of approximately 0.853, indicating that these two files are conceptually related. Although there are no direct coupling dependencies or call graph connections, the combination of co-change history and semantic similarity makes this the most likely candidate for synchronization.\n\n2. **StatisticsWindow.java**: Co-changed once with `CalcMatchStatistics.java`, resulting in a confidence level of 0.25. While the confidence level is lower than CalcStandardStatistics.java, it still shares a historical co-change relationship, suggesting that changes to `CalcMatchStatistics.java` may necessitate reviewing `StatisticsWindow.java`.\n\n3. **BaseStatisticsPanel.java**: Also co-changed once with `CalcMatchStatistics.java`, giving a confidence level of 0.25. It might be part of the same module or feature within the project, and thus should be considered for potential synchronization due to its shared co-change history.\n\n4. **StatCount.java**: Like the previous entities, it was co-changed once with `CalcMatchStatistics.java`, yielding a confidence level of 0.25. Changes to `CalcMatchStatistics.java` could imply the need to inspect `StatCount.java` to ensure consistency across related components.\n\n5. **MatchStatCounts.java**: Co-changed once alongside `CalcMatchStatistics.java` with a confidence level of 0.25. Its presence in the list suggests that it may be affected by changes in `CalcMatchStatistics.java` and should be reviewed accordingly.\n\n6. **StatisticsPanel.java**: Similar to other entities listed, it has been co-changed once with a confidence level of 0.25. The co-change history indicates that it might require synchronization when changes occur in `CalcMatchStatistics.java`.\n\n7. **BaseMatchStatisticsPanel.java**: With a single co-change and a confidence level of 0.25, this entity should also be reviewed for potential synchronization. It could share common functionality or context with `CalcMatchStatistics.java`.\n\n8. **IStatsConsumer.java**: Lastly, this entity has been co-changed once with `CalcMatchStatistics.java`, resulting in a confidence level of 0.25. As an interface, it might define contracts that are relevant to the behavior of `CalcMatchStatistics.java`, so any changes should consider its implications on `IStatsConsumer.java`.\n\nEach of these entities has been included in the change set based on their historical co-change relationships with `CalcMatchStatistics.java`.

Moreover, it has a high semantic similarity probability of approximately 0.853, indicating that these two files are conceptually related. Although there are no direct coupling dependencies or call graph connections, the combination of co-change history and semantic similarity makes this the most likely candidate for synchronization.\n\n2. **StatisticsWindow.java**: Co-changed once with `CalcMatchStatistics.java`, resulting in a confidence level of 0.25. While the confidence level is lower than CalcStandardStatistics.java, it still shares a historical co-change relationship, suggesting that changes to `CalcMatchStatistics.java` may necessitate reviewing `StatisticsWindow.java`.\n\n3. **BaseStatisticsPanel.java**: Also co-changed once with `CalcMatchStatistics.java`, giving a confidence level of 0.25. It might be part of the same module or feature within the project, and thus should be considered for potential synchronization due to its shared co-change history.\n\n4. **StatCount.java**: Like the previous entities, it was co-changed once with `CalcMatchStatistics.java`, yielding a confidence level of 0.25. Changes to `CalcMatchStatistics.java` could imply the need to inspect `StatCount.java` to ensure consistency across related components.\n\n5. **MatchStatCounts.java**: Co-changed once alongside `CalcMatchStatistics.java` with a confidence level of 0.25. Its presence in the list suggests that it may be affected by changes in `CalcMatchStatistics.java` and should be reviewed accordingly.\n\n6. **StatisticsPanel.java**: Similar to other entities listed, it has been co-changed once with a confidence level of 0.25. The co-change history indicates that it might require synchronization when changes occur in `CalcMatchStatistics.java`.\n\n7. **BaseMatchStatisticsPanel.java**: With a single co-change and a confidence level of 0.25, this entity should also be reviewed for potential synchronization. It could share common functionality or context with `CalcMatchStatistics.java`.\n\n8. **IStatsConsumer.java**: Lastly, this entity has been co-changed once with `CalcMatchStatistics.java`, resulting in a confidence level of 0.25. As an interface, it might define contracts that are relevant to the behavior of `CalcMatchStatistics.java`, so any changes should consider its implications on `IStatsConsumer.java`.\n\nEach of these entities has been included in the change set based on their historical co-change relationships with `CalcMatchStatistics.java`. The ordering reflects the likelihood of needing synchronized modifications, considering both the frequency of past co-changes and the semantic similarity where applicable.",

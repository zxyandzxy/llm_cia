Furthermore, the conceptual coupling between these two entities is relatively high at approximately 0.792, indicating a significant semantic similarity.

This means that whenever `AbstractAutoCompleterView.java` was changed, `AutoCompleterTableView.java` was also modified. Therefore, it is highly likely that changes to `AbstractAutoCompleterView.java` will require corresponding changes in `AutoCompleterTableView.java`.\n\n2. **ITokenizer**: The entity `ITokenizer` has a Return Type (RT) dependency with `AbstractAutoCompleterView.java`, meaning that there's a method within `AbstractAutoCompleterView.java` returning an instance of `ITokenizer`. Furthermore, the conceptual coupling between these two entities is relatively high at approximately 0.792, indicating a significant semantic similarity. Thus, any modification in `AbstractAutoCompleterView.java` might impact `ITokenizer` as well.\n\n3. **Core**: There are no direct coupling dependencies between `AbstractAutoCompleterView.java` and `Core`. Although `Core` was identified through call graph analysis, the lack of direct coupling suggests that changes in `AbstractAutoCompleterView.java` are unlikely to necessitate changes in `Core`.

In order to help solve the CIA mission, you should first understand some necessary concepts\uff1a\n(1)entity: Entities represent source code files in CIA tasks, and all the CIA tasks under study are based on the Java language, so entities are files with the .java extension.\n(2)starting entity: The starting entity is also called salient entity, and the salient entity is the root change that causes the modification of the rest of entities in a change set, while the rest of entities are the dependency modification along with the salient one.\nYou will be presented with a starting entity and tools (functions) will be provided to access the more information of the origin system. Your task is to gradually explain which entity really need to be synchronized, based on the starting entity and the information obtained through the function-call. You have 7 chances to call the function to get more information."

Since `OStrings` likely contains string constants or methods used within `Help.java`, any modifications to `Help.java` that involve changes to how these strings are used could necessitate corresponding changes in `OStrings`.\n\n2. **OConsts**: Similar to `OStrings`, this entity is also directly called or referenced by `Help.java`. If `OConsts` defines constants used within `Help.java`, then changes to `Help.java` that affect the usage or values of these constants would require updates to `OConsts` as well.\n\n3. **StaticUtils**: This utility class is also directly invoked by `Help.java`. Given its likely role in providing static helper methods or utilities used within `Help.java`, changes to `Help.java` that depend on functionality provided by `StaticUtils` may require adjustments in `StaticUtils` to maintain compatibility and correctness.\n\nThe entities from the co-change relationship (`EditorController`, `MainWindowMenuHandler`, `FileUtil`, `LicenseDialog`, `LastChangesDialog`) did not show any direct coupling dependencies with `Help.java`, suggesting that their past co-changes were not due to direct code interdependencies.

Your task is to gradually explain which entity really need to be synchronized, based on the starting entity and the information obtained through the function-call.

Since `OStrings` likely contains string constants or methods used within `Help.java`, any modifications to `Help.java` that involve changes to how these strings are used could necessitate corresponding changes in `OStrings`.\n\n2. **OConsts**: Similar to `OStrings`, this entity is also directly called or referenced by `Help.java`. If `OConsts` defines constants used within `Help.java`, then changes to `Help.java` that affect the usage or values of these constants would require updates to `OConsts` as well.\n\n3. **StaticUtils**: This utility class is also directly invoked by `Help.java`. Given its likely role in providing static helper methods or utilities used within `Help.java`, changes to `Help.java` that depend on functionality provided by `StaticUtils` may require adjustments in `StaticUtils` to maintain compatibility and correctness.\n\nThe entities from the co-change relationship (`EditorController`, `MainWindowMenuHandler`, `FileUtil`, `LicenseDialog`, `LastChangesDialog`) did not show any direct coupling dependencies with `Help.java`, suggesting that their past co-changes were not due to direct code interdependencies.

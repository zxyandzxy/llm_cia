Furthermore, it is directly invoked by `PoFilter.java`. These factors strongly suggest that changes to `PoFilter.java` will likely require corresponding adjustments to `AbstractFilter`.\n\n2. **StaticUtils**: Despite the absence of direct coupling dependencies, `StaticUtils` exhibits an even stronger conceptual coupling with `PoFilter.java` (semantic similarity score of 0.8365308). It is also directly used by `PoFilter.java`, implying that changes affecting `PoFilter.java` could impact the functionality provided by `StaticUtils`.\n\n3. **TestFilterBase**: With a confidence level of 0.42857142857142855 and support count of 3 from the co-change analysis, this entity shows a significant historical correlation with `PoFilter.java`. While there's no direct evidence of dependency or semantic similarity, its frequent co-occurrence with `PoFilter.java` during past modifications suggests a potential need for synchronization.\n\n4. **POFilterTest**: Similar to `TestFilterBase`, this test class has appeared alongside `PoFilter.java` in past modifications with a confidence of 0.42857142857142855 and support count of 3. Given its role as a test case for `PoFilter.java`, any functional changes in `PoFilter.java` might necessitate updates to `POFilterTest` to maintain test coverage.\n\n5. **FilterContext**: This entity is directly called by `PoFilter.java`, suggesting that changes in `PoFilter.java` could affect how `FilterContext` is utilized or interacted with. Although we don't have specific data on their coupling or conceptual similarities, the direct usage implies a need for attention during modifications.\n\n6. **Log**: As logging is often critical for debugging and monitoring, changes in `PoFilter.java` may introduce new logging requirements or alter existing ones, requiring adjustments in the `Log` entity.\n\n7. **ProtectedPart**: This entity is directly invoked by `PoFilter.java`, indicating that any changes in the filter's behavior or implementation might influence the handling of protected parts within the software.\n\n8. **TranslationException**: Since exceptions are typically thrown in response to specific conditions within the code, changes in `PoFilter.java`'s logic or error-handling routines could lead to modifications in how `TranslationException` is defined or used.\n\n9. **Instance**: The direct invocation of `Instance` by `PoFilter.java` suggests that any alterations in the way instances are managed or accessed through `PoFilter.java` might require corresponding changes in the `Instance` entity.\n\nThis change set represents entities that are most likely to be impacted by changes made to `PoFilter.java`, based on their co-change history, direct invocation, and semantic relationships.",

Additionally, given their historical co-change patterns, attention should also be paid to `TestFilterBase` and `POFilterTest` as they might need updates in parallel with `PoFilter.java`.\n\nThis concludes our change impact analysis for `PoFilter.java` within the OmegaT project.

It is also directly used by `PoFilter.java`, implying that changes affecting `PoFilter.java` could impact the functionality provided by `StaticUtils`.\n\n3. **TestFilterBase**: With a confidence level of 0.42857142857142855 and support count of 3 from the co-change analysis, this entity shows a significant historical correlation with `PoFilter.java`. While there's no direct evidence of dependency or semantic similarity, its frequent co-occurrence with `PoFilter.java` during past modifications suggests a potential need for synchronization.\n\n4. **POFilterTest**: Similar to `TestFilterBase`, this test class has appeared alongside `PoFilter.java` in past modifications with a confidence of 0.42857142857142855 and support count of 3. Given its role as a test case for `PoFilter.java`, any functional changes in `PoFilter.java` might necessitate updates to `POFilterTest` to maintain test coverage.\n\n5. **FilterContext**: This entity is directly called by `PoFilter.java`, suggesting that changes in `PoFilter.java` could affect how `FilterContext` is utilized or interacted with. Although we don't have specific data on their coupling or conceptual similarities, the direct usage implies a need for attention during modifications.\n\n6. **Log**: As logging is often critical for debugging and monitoring, changes in `PoFilter.java` may introduce new logging requirements or alter existing ones, requiring adjustments in the `Log` entity.\n\n7. **ProtectedPart**: This entity is directly invoked by `PoFilter.java`, indicating that any changes in the filter's behavior or implementation might influence the handling of protected parts within the software.\n\n8. **TranslationException**: Since exceptions are typically thrown in response to specific conditions within the code, changes in `PoFilter.java`'s logic or error-handling routines could lead to modifications in how `TranslationException` is defined or used.\n\n9. **Instance**: The direct invocation of `Instance` by `PoFilter.java` suggests that any alterations in the way instances are managed or accessed through `PoFilter.java` might require corresponding changes in the `Instance` entity.\n\nThis change set represents entities that are most likely to be impacted by changes made to `PoFilter.java`, based on their co-change history, direct invocation, and semantic relationships.",

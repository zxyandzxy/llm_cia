Despite lacking explicit code-level dependencies, it is highly probable that these two files need to be modified together to maintain consistency in the application's functionality.\n\n3. **TagAutoCompleterView.java**: This entity has a conceptual similarity probability of about 0.84 with `AutoCompleter.java`, which is quite high.

Changes to the base class could affect its derived classes, necessitating synchronized updates.\n\n5. **CharTableAutoCompleterView.java**: It appeared 3 times with a confidence of around 0.43. While there is no evidence of direct coupling dependencies, its co-change history with `AutoCompleter.java` suggests potential interdependencies worth considering during modifications.\n\n6. **AutotextAutoCompleterView.java** and **GlossaryAutoCompleterView.java**: Both have shown up 2 times with a confidence of approximately 0.29.

This means that every time `ISpellChecker.java` was changed in the version history, `SpellChecker` was also modified. Moreover, there is an Interface Implementation (II) coupling type where `SpellChecker` implements the `ISpellChecker` interface. Therefore, any changes to the methods or contracts defined in `ISpellChecker` will directly impact `SpellChecker`, making it essential for synchronization.\n\n2. **Token**: The `get_call_graph` function showed that `Token` is used within `ISpellChecker.java`, which indicates a direct usage dependency. Additionally, the `get_conceptual_coupling` function revealed a semantic similarity probability of approximately 0.795, suggesting that these two entities share significant conceptual overlap. While the co-change relationship is not as strong as with `SpellChecker`, the combination of call graph dependency and conceptual coupling justifies including `Token` in the change set, albeit with a lower likelihood of requiring synchronized modifications compared to `SpellChecker`.\n\nIn conclusion, when modifying `ISpellChecker.java`, it is crucial to synchronize changes with `SpellChecker` due to its high co-change confidence and interface implementation, while `Token` should also be considered for potential changes based on its direct usage and conceptual relevance.",

This means that every time `ISpellChecker.java` was changed in the version history, `SpellChecker` was also modified. Moreover, there is an Interface Implementation (II) coupling type where `SpellChecker` implements the `ISpellChecker` interface. Therefore, any changes to the methods or contracts defined in `ISpellChecker` will directly impact `SpellChecker`, making it essential for synchronization.\n\n2. **Token**: The `get_call_graph` function showed that `Token` is used within `ISpellChecker.java`, which indicates a direct usage dependency. Additionally, the `get_conceptual_coupling` function revealed a semantic similarity probability of approximately 0.795, suggesting that these two entities share significant conceptual overlap. While the co-change relationship is not as strong as with `SpellChecker`, the combination of call graph dependency and conceptual coupling justifies including `Token` in the change set, albeit with a lower likelihood of requiring synchronized modifications compared to `SpellChecker`.\n\nIn conclusion, when modifying `ISpellChecker.java`, it is crucial to synchronize changes with `SpellChecker` due to its high co-change confidence and interface implementation, while `Token` should also be considered for potential changes based on its direct usage and conceptual relevance.",

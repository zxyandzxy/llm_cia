Moreover, it exhibits strong conceptual coupling (similarity probability of 0.859), which suggests that these two files are functionally related and should be modified together to maintain consistency.\n\n2. **StatisticsWindow**: Similar to `CalcMatchStatistics`, this file also shows a high co-change relationship with `Statistics.java`. The conceptual coupling between these two files is significant (similarity probability of 0.826), indicating that they likely share similar functionalities or purposes within the project, supporting the need for synchronization during changes.\n\n3. **StatisticsInfo**: With a moderate level of support and confidence, this file tends to change alongside `Statistics.java`. While there's no direct evidence from coupling dependencies or conceptual coupling, the historical co-modification pattern justifies its inclusion in the change set.\n\n4. **MatchStatisticsCalculationThread**: Also showing a moderate co-change relationship, this file may require updates when `Statistics.java` is changed due to shared responsibilities or interdependencies within the codebase.\n\n5. **MatchStatisticsInfo**: Like `MatchStatisticsCalculationThread`, this file has a moderate co-change relationship with `Statistics.java`. Its inclusion in the change set is based on the same reasoning regarding shared functionality or potential interdependencies.\n\n6. **CalcStandardStatistics**: Although this file has lower support and confidence compared to the top two entities, its moderate co-change relationship and involvement in similar statistical calculations make it relevant for consideration during changes to `Statistics.java`.\n\n7. **OConsts**: Despite having the lowest support and confidence among the listed entities, `OConsts` is directly called by `Statistics.java`, as shown by the call graph analysis. This direct reference suggests that any changes to `Statistics.java` might impact `OConsts`, necessitating careful review and potential modifications.\n\nIn conclusion, the change set prioritizes entities based on their likelihood of requiring synchronized changes with `Statistics.java`, taking into account co-change relationships, conceptual coupling, and direct usage dependencies.",

While there's no direct evidence from coupling dependencies or conceptual coupling, the historical co-modification pattern justifies its inclusion in the change set.\n\n4. **MatchStatisticsCalculationThread**: Also showing a moderate co-change relationship, this file may require updates when `Statistics.java` is changed due to shared responsibilities or interdependencies within the codebase.\n\n5. **MatchStatisticsInfo**: Like `MatchStatisticsCalculationThread`, this file has a moderate co-change relationship with `Statistics.java`.

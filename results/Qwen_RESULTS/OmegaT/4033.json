This is further supported by the coupling dependencies where `SegmentBuilder` accesses several member variables of `EditorController`. Additionally, the conceptual coupling score of approximately 0.84 confirms their semantic similarity and functional interdependence.\n\n2. **CalcMarkersThread**: This entity has appeared together with `SegmentBuilder.java` in past changes 5 times out of 14, giving it a confidence level of 0.357. Although there's no direct call or coupling dependency information provided, the co-change frequency suggests a moderate likelihood of needing synchronization.\n\n3. **MarkerController**: Similar to `CalcMarkersThread`, this entity also shares a confidence level of 0.357 based on past co-changes. It indicates a potential need for synchronization whenever `SegmentBuilder.java` undergoes modifications.\n\n4. **IMarker**: Appeared in 3 out of 14 changes with `SegmentBuilder.java`, with a confidence of 0.214. Though the confidence is lower than the previous entities, its repeated appearance in past changes makes it a candidate for potential synchronization.\n\n5. **EntryMarks**: With a confidence of 0.143, this entity has been changed alongside `SegmentBuilder.java` twice. While not as strongly correlated as the top three, it still merits consideration due to the co-change history.\n\n6. **TransTips**: Co-changed twice with `SegmentBuilder.java`, resulting in a confidence of 0.143. Its inclusion in the change set is based on the observed pattern of co-modifications.\n\n7. **EditorUtils**: Similarly changed twice along with `SegmentBuilder.java`, with a confidence of 0.143. It might require updates if changes in `SegmentBuilder.java` affect its functionality.\n\n8. **Styles**: Changed twice with `SegmentBuilder.java`, with a confidence of 0.143. Given its low confidence, it is included in the change set more as a precautionary measure.\n\n9. **RealProject**: Also appearing twice in conjunction with `SegmentBuilder.java`, with a confidence of 0.143, this entity is considered for potential synchronization.\n\n10. **EditorSettings**: Like others with a confidence of 0.143, this entity has been changed twice with `SegmentBuilder.java` and may need to be reviewed for synchronization.\n\n11. **EditorTextArea3**: Appearing twice with `SegmentBuilder.java`, with a confidence of 0.143, it rounds off the list of entities that have shown a pattern of being changed together with `SegmentBuilder.java`.\n\nEach of these entities should be evaluated for potential synchronized modifications based on the analysis of co-change relationships, which reflect historical patterns of joint modifications during the evolution of the OmegaT project.

This is further supported by the coupling dependencies where `SegmentBuilder` accesses several member variables of `EditorController`. Additionally, the conceptual coupling score of approximately 0.84 confirms their semantic similarity and functional interdependence.\n\n2. **CalcMarkersThread**: This entity has appeared together with `SegmentBuilder.java` in past changes 5 times out of 14, giving it a confidence level of 0.357. Although there's no direct call or coupling dependency information provided, the co-change frequency suggests a moderate likelihood of needing synchronization.\n\n3. **MarkerController**: Similar to `CalcMarkersThread`, this entity also shares a confidence level of 0.357 based on past co-changes. It indicates a potential need for synchronization whenever `SegmentBuilder.java` undergoes modifications.\n\n4. **IMarker**: Appeared in 3 out of 14 changes with `SegmentBuilder.java`, with a confidence of 0.214. Though the confidence is lower than the previous entities, its repeated appearance in past changes makes it a candidate for potential synchronization.\n\n5. **EntryMarks**: With a confidence of 0.143, this entity has been changed alongside `SegmentBuilder.java` twice. While not as strongly correlated as the top three, it still merits consideration due to the co-change history.\n\n6. **TransTips**: Co-changed twice with `SegmentBuilder.java`, resulting in a confidence of 0.143. Its inclusion in the change set is based on the observed pattern of co-modifications.\n\n7. **EditorUtils**: Similarly changed twice along with `SegmentBuilder.java`, with a confidence of 0.143. It might require updates if changes in `SegmentBuilder.java` affect its functionality.\n\n8. **Styles**: Changed twice with `SegmentBuilder.java`, with a confidence of 0.143. Given its low confidence, it is included in the change set more as a precautionary measure.\n\n9. **RealProject**: Also appearing twice in conjunction with `SegmentBuilder.java`, with a confidence of 0.143, this entity is considered for potential synchronization.\n\n10. **EditorSettings**: Like others with a confidence of 0.143, this entity has been changed twice with `SegmentBuilder.java` and may need to be reviewed for synchronization.\n\n11. **EditorTextArea3**: Appearing twice with `SegmentBuilder.java`, with a confidence of 0.143, it rounds off the list of entities that have shown a pattern of being changed together with `SegmentBuilder.java`.\n\nEach of these entities should be evaluated for potential synchronized modifications based on the analysis of co-change relationships, which reflect historical patterns of joint modifications during the evolution of the OmegaT project.

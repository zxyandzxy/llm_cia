Although there are no direct coupling dependencies, their high semantic similarity indicates that they likely share common functionality or concepts within the project. Therefore, changes in `MatchStatCounts.java` might necessitate corresponding changes in `CalcMatchStatistics.java` to maintain consistency.\n\n2. **OConsts.java**: The conceptual coupling between `MatchStatCounts.java` and `OConsts.java` is also significant, with a similarity probability of 0.73635584. While there is no evidence of direct code interdependencies, the semantic relationship suggests that these entities might be conceptually related, possibly part of the same feature module or responding to similar requirements. Thus, it's advisable to consider synchronizing modifications.\n\n3. **StatisticsWindow.java**: There is no direct coupling dependency nor a reported conceptual coupling value. However, the co-change history shows that it has been modified alongside `MatchStatCounts.java`. This implies that these two files have been historically changed together, potentially due to shared functional requirements or as part of the same user stories. It should be reviewed for potential synchronization needs.\n\n4. **StatCount.java**: Similar to `StatisticsWindow.java`, there is no direct coupling dependency or provided conceptual coupling data. Nonetheless, the co-change pattern observed in the version history suggests that `StatCount.java` might require synchronized changes when `MatchStatCounts.java` is updated. Both files seem to be closely related in terms of project evolution and maintenance.\n\nThe elements in the Change set are sorted in descending order of the likelihood of synchronized modifications based on the strength of their conceptual coupling and historical co-change patterns.

Although there are no direct coupling dependencies, their high semantic similarity indicates that they likely share common functionality or concepts within the project. Therefore, changes in `MatchStatCounts.java` might necessitate corresponding changes in `CalcMatchStatistics.java` to maintain consistency.\n\n2. **OConsts.java**: The conceptual coupling between `MatchStatCounts.java` and `OConsts.java` is also significant, with a similarity probability of 0.73635584. While there is no evidence of direct code interdependencies, the semantic relationship suggests that these entities might be conceptually related, possibly part of the same feature module or responding to similar requirements. Thus, it's advisable to consider synchronizing modifications.\n\n3. **StatisticsWindow.java**: There is no direct coupling dependency nor a reported conceptual coupling value. However, the co-change history shows that it has been modified alongside `MatchStatCounts.java`. This implies that these two files have been historically changed together, potentially due to shared functional requirements or as part of the same user stories. It should be reviewed for potential synchronization needs.\n\n4. **StatCount.java**: Similar to `StatisticsWindow.java`, there is no direct coupling dependency or provided conceptual coupling data. Nonetheless, the co-change pattern observed in the version history suggests that `StatCount.java` might require synchronized changes when `MatchStatCounts.java` is updated. Both files seem to be closely related in terms of project evolution and maintenance.\n\nThe elements in the Change set are sorted in descending order of the likelihood of synchronized modifications based on the strength of their conceptual coupling and historical co-change patterns. Entities with stronger conceptual similarities are placed higher, assuming a greater likelihood of requiring concurrent changes.",

Although other entities like `FuzzyMatcher` and `NearString` have shown historical co-change patterns, the lack of direct coupling dependencies and lower conceptual coupling reduces the necessity to include them in the synchronization process.\n\nIt's also worth noting that other entities called by `FindMatchesThread.java` could potentially require synchronization depending on the nature of the changes being made.

Changes to `ISimilarityCalculator` are likely to necessitate changes in `FindMatchesThread.java` to maintain consistent behavior.\n\n2. FuzzyMatcher (Co-change Support: 1, Confidence: 0.5): Although there are no direct coupling dependencies, historical data shows that `FuzzyMatcher` was often changed together with `FindMatchesThread.java`. It may be due to logical relationships or interface contracts that require synchronization when changes occur.\n\n3. NearString (Co-change Support: 1, Confidence: 0.5): Similar to `FuzzyMatcher`, there is a co-change relationship without direct coupling dependencies. Changes might still need to be synchronized based on shared functionality or context not directly detected by the coupling analysis.\n\n4. StringEntry: This entity is called by `FindMatchesThread.java` and could be related to its operations, so it's included in the change set as a precautionary measure for potential required updates.\n\n5. ITokenizer: As another entity used by `FindMatchesThread.java`, it may have dependencies or interactions that could be affected by changes, thus included in the change set.\n\n6. Core: Since this entity is also used by `FindMatchesThread.java`, any changes here might impact the calling logic within `FindMatchesThread.java`.\n\n7. Token: Included due to its usage by `FindMatchesThread.java`, which suggests it plays a role in the operations performed by the thread.\n\n8. LevenshteinDistance: Called by `FindMatchesThread.java`, it is part of the algorithmic process and may require synchronization if the implementation details or interfaces change.\n\n9. OConsts: Given its usage by `FindMatchesThread.java`, changes in constants or configurations could affect the behavior of the thread.\n\n10.

Although other entities like `FuzzyMatcher` and `NearString` have shown historical co-change patterns, the lack of direct coupling dependencies and lower conceptual coupling reduces the necessity to include them in the synchronization process.\n\nIt's also worth noting that other entities called by `FindMatchesThread.java` could potentially require synchronization depending on the nature of the changes being made.

ISimilarityCalculator (Conceptual Coupling: 0.7789843): This entity has a strong conceptual relationship with `FindMatchesThread.java`, indicating that they share common functionality or context. Changes to `ISimilarityCalculator` are likely to necessitate changes in `FindMatchesThread.java` to maintain consistent behavior.\n\n2. FuzzyMatcher (Co-change Support: 1, Confidence: 0.5): Although there are no direct coupling dependencies, historical data shows that `FuzzyMatcher` was often changed together with `FindMatchesThread.java`. It may be due to logical relationships or interface contracts that require synchronization when changes occur.\n\n3. NearString (Co-change Support: 1, Confidence: 0.5): Similar to `FuzzyMatcher`, there is a co-change relationship without direct coupling dependencies. Changes might still need to be synchronized based on shared functionality or context not directly detected by the coupling analysis.\n\n4. StringEntry: This entity is called by `FindMatchesThread.java` and could be related to its operations, so it's included in the change set as a precautionary measure for potential required updates.\n\n5. ITokenizer: As another entity used by `FindMatchesThread.java`, it may have dependencies or interactions that could be affected by changes, thus included in the change set.\n\n6. Core: Since this entity is also used by `FindMatchesThread.java`, any changes here might impact the calling logic within `FindMatchesThread.java`.\n\n7. Token: Included due to its usage by `FindMatchesThread.java`, which suggests it plays a role in the operations performed by the thread.\n\n8. LevenshteinDistance: Called by `FindMatchesThread.java`, it is part of the algorithmic process and may require synchronization if the implementation details or interfaces change.\n\n9. OConsts: Given its usage by `FindMatchesThread.java`, changes in constants or configurations could affect the behavior of the thread.\n\n10.

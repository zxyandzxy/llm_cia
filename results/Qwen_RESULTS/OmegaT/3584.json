This means that every time `InfixDialect.java` was changed in the past, `InfixFilter` was also modified. With a confidence of 1.0, it is highly likely that changes to `InfixDialect.java` will necessitate corresponding changes to `InfixFilter`.\n\n2. **DefaultXMLDialect**: Although there is no co-change relationship detected between `InfixDialect.java` and `DefaultXMLDialect.java`, the `get_call_graph` function revealed that `InfixDialect.java` makes use of `DefaultXMLDialect.java`. Since there is a direct call dependency, any changes made to `InfixDialect.java` could potentially impact `DefaultXMLDialect.java`. However, due to the lack of conceptual coupling (`get_conceptual_coupling` returned a similarity probability of `0.0`) and no co-change history, the need for synchronization is less certain than with `InfixFilter`.\n\nIn conclusion, when modifying `InfixDialect.java`, you should first consider synchronizing those changes with `InfixFilter` because of the strong co-change relationship.

This means that every time `InfixDialect.java` was changed in the past, `InfixFilter` was also modified.

Since there is a direct call dependency, any changes made to `InfixDialect.java` could potentially impact `DefaultXMLDialect.java`. However, due to the lack of conceptual coupling (`get_conceptual_coupling` returned a similarity probability of `0.0`) and no co-change history, the need for synchronization is less certain than with `InfixFilter`.\n\nIn conclusion, when modifying `InfixDialect.java`, you should first consider synchronizing those changes with `InfixFilter` because of the strong co-change relationship.

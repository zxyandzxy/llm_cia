In order to help solve the CIA mission, you should first understand some necessary concepts\uff1a\n(1)entity: Entities represent source code files in CIA tasks, and all the CIA tasks under study are based on the Java language, so entities are files with the .java extension.\n(2)starting entity: The starting entity is also called salient entity, and the salient entity is the root change that causes the modification of the rest of entities in a change set, while the rest of entities are the dependency modification along with the salient one.\nYou will be presented with a starting entity and tools (functions) will be provided to access the more information of the origin system. Your task is to gradually explain which entity really need to be synchronized, based on the starting entity and the information obtained through the function-call. You have 7 chances to call the function to get more information."

Despite the absence of direct coupling dependencies, it is highly likely that changes to `StatCount.java` will require corresponding changes in `CalcStandardStatistics.java`, possibly due to shared functionality or being part of the same feature updates.\n\n2. **CalcMatchStatistics.java**: Similar to `CalcStandardStatistics.java`, this entity also shows a strong co-change relationship with `StatCount.java` (support: 1, confidence: 1.0). Even though there are no direct coupling dependencies, it's evident that these two entities are often updated together, suggesting they should be reviewed and potentially synchronized when changes occur.\n\n3. **SourceTextEntry**: While `SourceTextEntry` does not have any direct coupling dependencies with `StatCount.java`, it is directly called by `StatCount.java`. Therefore, changes in `StatCount.java` could affect how `SourceTextEntry` is used or interacted with, necessitating a review and possible synchronization to ensure compatibility and correct behavior.\n\n4. **StaticUtils**: Like `SourceTextEntry`, `StaticUtils` is directly called by `StatCount.java` but does not share any direct coupling dependencies. Changes in `StatCount.java` may impact the usage of utilities provided by `StaticUtils`, making it important to assess whether modifications are needed to maintain consistency and functionality.\n\nThe elements in the Change set are sorted in descending order of the likelihood of synchronized modifications based on the strength of their co-change relationship with `StatCount.java`.

Your task is to gradually explain which entity really need to be synchronized, based on the starting entity and the information obtained through the function-call.

Despite the absence of direct coupling dependencies, it is highly likely that changes to `StatCount.java` will require corresponding changes in `CalcStandardStatistics.java`, possibly due to shared functionality or being part of the same feature updates.\n\n2. **CalcMatchStatistics.java**: Similar to `CalcStandardStatistics.java`, this entity also shows a strong co-change relationship with `StatCount.java` (support: 1, confidence: 1.0). Even though there are no direct coupling dependencies, it's evident that these two entities are often updated together, suggesting they should be reviewed and potentially synchronized when changes occur.\n\n3. **SourceTextEntry**: While `SourceTextEntry` does not have any direct coupling dependencies with `StatCount.java`, it is directly called by `StatCount.java`. Therefore, changes in `StatCount.java` could affect how `SourceTextEntry` is used or interacted with, necessitating a review and possible synchronization to ensure compatibility and correct behavior.\n\n4. **StaticUtils**: Like `SourceTextEntry`, `StaticUtils` is directly called by `StatCount.java` but does not share any direct coupling dependencies.

It's likely that changes to `Core.java` will necessitate adjustments to how menus are handled within the main window, especially if there are changes related to user interaction or new features.\n\n2. **`MainWindow`**: The coupling dependency analysis between `Core.java` and `MainWindow` reveals a direct relationship through method member variable usage (MMAUA) in the `initializeGUI` method, indicating that any significant changes to the initialization process or GUI structure within `Core.java` might require corresponding adjustments in `MainWindow`. Furthermore, the high conceptual similarity suggests they serve similar functionalities within the application.\n\n3. **`Main`**: This entity appears with 3 supports and a confidence level of 0.2143. Given its central role as an entry point for the application, it is highly probable that changes to core functionality could impact the overall flow of the program, thus requiring updates to `Main`.\n\n4. **`GlossaryTextArea`**: With 3 supports and a confidence level of 0.2143, `GlossaryTextArea` interacts with `Core.java` directly and is often changed when `Core.java` changes. This implies that modifications affecting glossary-related features in the core module would likely need to be reflected here.\n\n5. **`CommentsTextArea`**: Although not having the highest support count, this entity is included due to its direct call relationship with `Core.java`, suggesting that changes in handling comments or text areas may need to be propagated here.\n\n6. **`LanguageToolWrapper`**: With 2 supports and a confidence level of 0.1429, this entity shows a moderate co-change tendency with `Core.java`. Given its potential role in providing grammar checking or language services, changes in `Core.java` related to such features might require synchronization.\n\n7. **`TransTipsMarker`**: This entity also has 2 supports with a confidence level of 0.1429 and shares a direct relationship with `Core.java`. Changes impacting translation tips or markers should be considered for synchronization to ensure consistency across these components.\n\nThese entities have been chosen based on their co-change relationships, direct calls, coupling dependencies, and conceptual similarities with `Core.java`, indicating a high likelihood of needing synchronized modifications.",

It's likely that changes to `Core.java` will necessitate adjustments to how menus are handled within the main window, especially if there are changes related to user interaction or new features.\n\n2. **`MainWindow`**: The coupling dependency analysis between `Core.java` and `MainWindow` reveals a direct relationship through method member variable usage (MMAUA) in the `initializeGUI` method, indicating that any significant changes to the initialization process or GUI structure within `Core.java` might require corresponding adjustments in `MainWindow`. Furthermore, the high conceptual similarity suggests they serve similar functionalities within the application.\n\n3. **`Main`**: This entity appears with 3 supports and a confidence level of 0.2143. Given its central role as an entry point for the application, it is highly probable that changes to core functionality could impact the overall flow of the program, thus requiring updates to `Main`.\n\n4. **`GlossaryTextArea`**: With 3 supports and a confidence level of 0.2143, `GlossaryTextArea` interacts with `Core.java` directly and is often changed when `Core.java` changes. This implies that modifications affecting glossary-related features in the core module would likely need to be reflected here.\n\n5. **`CommentsTextArea`**: Although not having the highest support count, this entity is included due to its direct call relationship with `Core.java`, suggesting that changes in handling comments or text areas may need to be propagated here.\n\n6. **`LanguageToolWrapper`**: With 2 supports and a confidence level of 0.1429, this entity shows a moderate co-change tendency with `Core.java`. Given its potential role in providing grammar checking or language services, changes in `Core.java` related to such features might require synchronization.\n\n7. **`TransTipsMarker`**: This entity also has 2 supports with a confidence level of 0.1429 and shares a direct relationship with `Core.java`. Changes impacting translation tips or markers should be considered for synchronization to ensure consistency across these components.\n\nThese entities have been chosen based on their co-change relationships, direct calls, coupling dependencies, and conceptual similarities with `Core.java`, indicating a high likelihood of needing synchronized modifications.",

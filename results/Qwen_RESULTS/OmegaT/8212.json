Although there are no direct coupling dependencies, it's likely that changes to the functionality or interface of `EditorUtils.java` will require corresponding updates to its test cases in `EditorUtilsTest.java`.\n\n2. **StringUtil**: The `get_call_graph` function showed that `StringUtil` is referenced by `EditorUtils.java`. Since this entity also appeared in the co-change results (Support: 1, Confidence: 0.2), it suggests that changes to `EditorUtils.java` might impact `StringUtil`, and vice versa.\n\n3. **EditorController**: This entity appears in the co-change results (Support: 2, Confidence: 0.4) and could be related to the same functional area as `EditorUtils.java`. It may need to synchronize changes if the user interface or control flow involving editors is affected.\n\n4. **ITokenizer**: This is an interface used by `EditorUtils.java`. Changes in `EditorUtils.java` might require adjustments to how it interacts with tokenizers, necessitating changes to any implementing classes.\n\n5. **Token**: Similar to `ITokenizer`, `Token` is a class directly used by `EditorUtils.java`. Any change affecting the handling of tokens within `EditorUtils.java` would likely impact `Token` as well.\n\n6. **GlossaryEntry**: This entity is called or referenced by `EditorUtils.java` and thus might need to be updated in response to changes in the editor's glossary management features.\n\n7. **GlossaryManager**: As another dependency of `EditorUtils.java`, `GlossaryManager` handles glossary-related operations that might need synchronization with `EditorUtils.java`.\n\n8. **Core**: This entity represents foundational components of the application and is used by `EditorUtils.java`. Changes here could have widespread effects, but since `Core` is a broad component, its necessity for synchronization depends on the specifics of the change in `EditorUtils.java`.\n\nIt's important to note that the actual need for synchronized modifications should be assessed carefully, considering the nature of the change in `EditorUtils.java` and the specific role of each dependent entity.

Although there are no direct coupling dependencies, it's likely that changes to the functionality or interface of `EditorUtils.java` will require corresponding updates to its test cases in `EditorUtilsTest.java`.\n\n2. **StringUtil**: The `get_call_graph` function showed that `StringUtil` is referenced by `EditorUtils.java`. Since this entity also appeared in the co-change results (Support: 1, Confidence: 0.2), it suggests that changes to `EditorUtils.java` might impact `StringUtil`, and vice versa.\n\n3. **EditorController**: This entity appears in the co-change results (Support: 2, Confidence: 0.4) and could be related to the same functional area as `EditorUtils.java`. It may need to synchronize changes if the user interface or control flow involving editors is affected.\n\n4. **ITokenizer**: This is an interface used by `EditorUtils.java`. Changes in `EditorUtils.java` might require adjustments to how it interacts with tokenizers, necessitating changes to any implementing classes.\n\n5. **Token**: Similar to `ITokenizer`, `Token` is a class directly used by `EditorUtils.java`. Any change affecting the handling of tokens within `EditorUtils.java` would likely impact `Token` as well.\n\n6. **GlossaryEntry**: This entity is called or referenced by `EditorUtils.java` and thus might need to be updated in response to changes in the editor's glossary management features.\n\n7. **GlossaryManager**: As another dependency of `EditorUtils.java`, `GlossaryManager` handles glossary-related operations that might need synchronization with `EditorUtils.java`.\n\n8. **Core**: This entity represents foundational components of the application and is used by `EditorUtils.java`. Changes here could have widespread effects, but since `Core` is a broad component, its necessity for synchronization depends on the specifics of the change in `EditorUtils.java`.\n\nIt's important to note that the actual need for synchronized modifications should be assessed carefully, considering the nature of the change in `EditorUtils.java` and the specific role of each dependent entity.

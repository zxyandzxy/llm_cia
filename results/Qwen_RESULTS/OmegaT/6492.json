Furthermore, the conceptual coupling between these two entities is high at approximately 0.854. The strong semantic similarity suggests that changes to `RuntimePreferences.java` may require corresponding adjustments in `RealProject.java` to maintain consistency and ensure proper functioning within the OmegaT project.\n\n2. **Main.java**: Similar to `RealProject.java`, this entity also shares a co-change relationship with `RuntimePreferences.java` based on historical version data (support count: 1, confidence: 1.0). The `get_conceptual_coupling` function returned a value of approximately 0.834, reflecting a significant conceptual overlap. Even though there are no direct call or coupling dependencies, the conceptual connection implies that modifications to `RuntimePreferences.java` could impact `Main.java`. Therefore, it's important to consider synchronizing changes with `Main.java` to avoid potential issues arising from conceptual drift.\n\nThe elements in the Change set are sorted in descending order of the likelihood of synchronized modifications, which is determined by both the strength of their conceptual coupling and the support/confidence of their co-change relationship.

Furthermore, the conceptual coupling between these two entities is high at approximately 0.854. The strong semantic similarity suggests that changes to `RuntimePreferences.java` may require corresponding adjustments in `RealProject.java` to maintain consistency and ensure proper functioning within the OmegaT project.\n\n2. **Main.java**: Similar to `RealProject.java`, this entity also shares a co-change relationship with `RuntimePreferences.java` based on historical version data (support count: 1, confidence: 1.0). The `get_conceptual_coupling` function returned a value of approximately 0.834, reflecting a significant conceptual overlap. Even though there are no direct call or coupling dependencies, the conceptual connection implies that modifications to `RuntimePreferences.java` could impact `Main.java`. Therefore, it's important to consider synchronizing changes with `Main.java` to avoid potential issues arising from conceptual drift.\n\nThe elements in the Change set are sorted in descending order of the likelihood of synchronized modifications, which is determined by both the strength of their conceptual coupling and the support/confidence of their co-change relationship. Hence, `RealProject.java` is listed first due to its slightly higher conceptual coupling score compared to `Main.java`.",

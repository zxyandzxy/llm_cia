This ensures that modifications to `SegmentBuilder` do not break the expected behavior or functionality provided by `EditorController`.\n\nSince we have used 5 out of 7 available function calls, there are still opportunities to explore other entities if needed.

The coupling dependencies show that `SegmentBuilder` accesses several member variables of an instance of `EditorController`, indicating a direct dependency. Furthermore, the conceptual coupling between these two entities is quite high (approximately 0.84), suggesting they share similar functionality or purpose within the system. Therefore, it is very likely that any changes to `SegmentBuilder` will require corresponding changes in `EditorController`.\n\n2. **CalcMarkersThread**: With a support count of 5 and confidence of approximately 0.36, this entity also frequently co-changes with `SegmentBuilder.java`. Although there is no additional information provided about the nature of their relationship beyond the co-change frequency, the relatively high support and confidence scores suggest that `CalcMarkersThread` should be considered for synchronization when `SegmentBuilder` is modified.\n\n3. **IMarker**: Having a support count of 3 and confidence of approximately 0.21, `IMarker` has a lower but still significant co-change relationship with `SegmentBuilder.java`. While the exact reason for this co-change pattern isn't clear from the current analysis, its presence in the list suggests that `IMarker` may have some form of indirect dependency or shared functionality with `SegmentBuilder`.\n\n4. **MarkerController**: Similar to `IMarker`, `MarkerController` has a support count of 5 and a confidence of approximately 0.36. Its inclusion in the change set is justified by the moderate co-change frequency, indicating potential indirect dependencies or interactions with `SegmentBuilder`.\n\n5. **TransTipsMarker**: With a support count of 1 and confidence of approximately 0.07, `TransTipsMarker` has the lowest score among the selected entities. However, given its appearance in the co-change history, it's prudent to include it in the change set for thoroughness, even though the need for synchronization might not be as critical as with the other entities listed above.\n\nIn summary, while EditorController stands out as the most crucial entity to synchronize due to strong evidence of both structural and semantic coupling, the rest of the entities in the change set should also be monitored for necessary updates when changes are made to `SegmentBuilder.java`.",

The coupling dependencies show that `SegmentBuilder` accesses several member variables of an instance of `EditorController`, indicating a direct dependency. Furthermore, the conceptual coupling between these two entities is quite high (approximately 0.84), suggesting they share similar functionality or purpose within the system. Therefore, it is very likely that any changes to `SegmentBuilder` will require corresponding changes in `EditorController`.\n\n2. **CalcMarkersThread**: With a support count of 5 and confidence of approximately 0.36, this entity also frequently co-changes with `SegmentBuilder.java`. Although there is no additional information provided about the nature of their relationship beyond the co-change frequency, the relatively high support and confidence scores suggest that `CalcMarkersThread` should be considered for synchronization when `SegmentBuilder` is modified.\n\n3. **IMarker**: Having a support count of 3 and confidence of approximately 0.21, `IMarker` has a lower but still significant co-change relationship with `SegmentBuilder.java`. While the exact reason for this co-change pattern isn't clear from the current analysis, its presence in the list suggests that `IMarker` may have some form of indirect dependency or shared functionality with `SegmentBuilder`.\n\n4. **MarkerController**: Similar to `IMarker`, `MarkerController` has a support count of 5 and a confidence of approximately 0.36. Its inclusion in the change set is justified by the moderate co-change frequency, indicating potential indirect dependencies or interactions with `SegmentBuilder`.\n\n5. **TransTipsMarker**: With a support count of 1 and confidence of approximately 0.07, `TransTipsMarker` has the lowest score among the selected entities. However, given its appearance in the co-change history, it's prudent to include it in the change set for thoroughness, even though the need for synchronization might not be as critical as with the other entities listed above.\n\nIn summary, while EditorController stands out as the most crucial entity to synchronize due to strong evidence of both structural and semantic coupling, the rest of the entities in the change set should also be monitored for necessary updates when changes are made to `SegmentBuilder.java`.",

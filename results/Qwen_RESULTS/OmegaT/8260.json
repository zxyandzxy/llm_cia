However, there are no direct code-level dependencies.\n  \n- **MainWindow.java**: Likely to need changes given moderate co-change confidence with `MainWindowMenuHandler.java`.\n\n- **Preferences.java**: Should be reviewed for changes as it's directly called by `MainWindowMenuHandler.java` and has a moderate co-change confidence.\n\n- **StatisticsWindow.java**, **SearchWindowController.java**, and **EditorSettings.java**: These entities have been directly interacted with by `MainWindowMenuHandler.java`, so they should be checked for necessary updates.\n\nTo summarize, when making changes to `MainWindowMenuHandler.java`, you should pay special attention to synchronizing changes with `MainWindowMenu.java`, `MainWindow.java`, `Preferences.java`, and also review any potential impacts on `StatisticsWindow.java`, `SearchWindowController.java`, and `EditorSettings.java`.\n\nIf you have additional concerns or need further investigation into other entities, please let me know.

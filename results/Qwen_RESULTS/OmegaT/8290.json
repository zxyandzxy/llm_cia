Furthermore, it has a high conceptual coupling (semantic similarity probability of 0.8312809) with the starting entity, which implies a shared functionality or purpose.\n\n3. **TeamSettings**: It appears twice in the list due to its presence both in the co-change relationships and in the call graph.

While its co-change relationship is less strong, it may still be relevant due to potentially similar authentication-related functionalities.\n\n7. **HTTPRemoteRepository**: With a support count of 1 and a confidence level of 0.33, it shares a weaker co-change relationship but could still be impacted by changes in `SVNAuthenticationManager.java`.\n\n8. **RemoteRepositoryProvider**, **IRemoteRepository2**, **RepositoryDefinition**: These entities have a support count of 1 and a confidence level of 0.33.

Despite having no coupling dependencies, its historical co-change pattern suggests a high likelihood of needing synchronized changes.\n\n2. **GITCredentialsProvider**: With a support count of 3 and a confidence level of 1.0, this entity also shows a strong co-change relationship with `SVNAuthenticationManager.java`. Furthermore, it has a high conceptual coupling (semantic similarity probability of 0.8312809) with the starting entity, which implies a shared functionality or purpose.\n\n3. **TeamSettings**: It appears twice in the list due to its presence both in the co-change relationships and in the call graph. With a support count of 2 and a confidence level of 0.67, it is likely to be involved in the same feature area as `SVNAuthenticationManager.java`, thus requiring synchronization.\n\n4. **GITRemoteRepository2**: This entity has a support count of 2 and a confidence level of 0.67. Its moderate co-change relationship suggests that it might need to be updated alongside `SVNAuthenticationManager.java`.\n\n5. **RebaseAndCommit**: Although its support count is lower at 2 and the confidence level is 0.67, it still indicates a notable co-change relationship, suggesting it should be considered for potential synchronized modifications.\n\n6. **SVNUserPassDialog**: This entity has a support count of 1 and a confidence level of 0.33. While its co-change relationship is less strong, it may still be relevant due to potentially similar authentication-related functionalities.\n\n7. **HTTPRemoteRepository**: With a support count of 1 and a confidence level of 0.33, it shares a weaker co-change relationship but could still be impacted by changes in `SVNAuthenticationManager.java`.\n\n8. **RemoteRepositoryProvider**, **IRemoteRepository2**, **RepositoryDefinition**: These entities have a support count of 1 and a confidence level of 0.33.

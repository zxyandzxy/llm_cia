Although there are no direct coupling dependencies, the co-change relationship shows that whenever `FilenamePatternsEditor.java` was modified, `FilenamePatternsEditorController.java` was also changed (support count of 1 and confidence of 1.0). This indicates that they likely share similar functionality or context within the application, suggesting that changes in one should prompt a review of the other.\n\n2. **ProjectPropertiesDialog.java**: Similar to `FilenamePatternsEditorController.java`, this entity also shares a strong conceptual relationship with `FilenamePatternsEditor.java` (semantic similarity probability of 0.847). The co-change relationship data further supports this by showing that modifications to `FilenamePatternsEditor.java` were always accompanied by changes to `ProjectPropertiesDialog.java` (with a support count of 1 and confidence of 1.0). Thus, it is highly probable that these two files need to be synchronized to maintain consistency across related functionalities.\n\nThe elements in the Change set are sorted in descending order of the likelihood of synchronized modifications based on their conceptual coupling scores. However, since both entities have very close scores and identical co-change support/confidence values, the ordering reflects the strength of their semantic relationships rather than a strict hierarchy. Both entities are critical to consider when making changes to `FilenamePatternsEditor.java`. \n\nIt's important to note that while `OStrings` was identified through the call graph, it does not follow the same co-change pattern and thus is not included in the change set. It may require separate consideration if its usage context within `FilenamePatternsEditor.java` suggests a need for modification.",

Although there are no direct coupling dependencies, the co-change relationship shows that whenever `FilenamePatternsEditor.java` was modified, `FilenamePatternsEditorController.java` was also changed (support count of 1 and confidence of 1.0). This indicates that they likely share similar functionality or context within the application, suggesting that changes in one should prompt a review of the other.\n\n2. **ProjectPropertiesDialog.java**: Similar to `FilenamePatternsEditorController.java`, this entity also shares a strong conceptual relationship with `FilenamePatternsEditor.java` (semantic similarity probability of 0.847). The co-change relationship data further supports this by showing that modifications to `FilenamePatternsEditor.java` were always accompanied by changes to `ProjectPropertiesDialog.java` (with a support count of 1 and confidence of 1.0). Thus, it is highly probable that these two files need to be synchronized to maintain consistency across related functionalities.\n\nThe elements in the Change set are sorted in descending order of the likelihood of synchronized modifications based on their conceptual coupling scores. However, since both entities have very close scores and identical co-change support/confidence values, the ordering reflects the strength of their semantic relationships rather than a strict hierarchy. Both entities are critical to consider when making changes to `FilenamePatternsEditor.java`. \n\nIt's important to note that while `OStrings` was identified through the call graph, it does not follow the same co-change pattern and thus is not included in the change set. It may require separate consideration if its usage context within `FilenamePatternsEditor.java` suggests a need for modification.",

In order to help solve the CIA mission, you should first understand some necessary concepts\uff1a\n(1)entity: Entities represent source code files in CIA tasks, and all the CIA tasks under study are based on the Java language, so entities are files with the .java extension.\n(2)starting entity: The starting entity is also called salient entity, and the salient entity is the root change that causes the modification of the rest of entities in a change set, while the rest of entities are the dependency modification along with the salient one.\nYou will be presented with a starting entity and tools (functions) will be provided to access the more information of the origin system. Your task is to gradually explain which entity really need to be synchronized, based on the starting entity and the information obtained through the function-call. You have 7 chances to call the function to get more information."

It should be reviewed during any change process.\n\n4. **PerFileMatchStatisticsPanel**: Similar to other panels, this entity might share underlying mechanisms with `StatisticsPanel.java`, making it a candidate for synchronized changes due to its functional relevance.\n\n5. **MatchStatisticsPanel**: Another panel entity that could be part of the same module or feature within the application. Its presence in the co-changed list suggests a potential need for synchronization.\n\n6. **StringArrayTableModel**: While not directly called by `StatisticsPanel.java`, this entity may serve as an important data model for statistics-related tables, thus requiring attention during changes to ensure consistency.\n\n7. **TitledTablePanel**: Despite no direct coupling dependencies being detected, this entity might still be relevant in the context of displaying statistical information alongside `StatisticsPanel.java`.\n\n8. **BaseStatisticsPanel**: As a foundational class, it could contain common functionalities used by `StatisticsPanel.java`.

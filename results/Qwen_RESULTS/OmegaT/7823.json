It shares the same level of support and confidence in terms of co-change history. Given its conceptual relationship, it is likely that modifications to `FileUtilTest.java` could necessitate parallel adjustments in `ScriptingTest.java`.\n\n3. **ScriptRunner**: Although `ScriptRunner` was identified through the co-change analysis, it has been removed from the project due to version iteration. Despite its historical connection with `FileUtilTest.java`, it no longer exists in the current codebase.

Furthermore, the conceptual coupling between these two entities is relatively high (0.718), suggesting they share similar responsibilities or are part of the same feature set within the OmegaT project.\n\n2. `GlossaryManager.java` - Support: 5, Confidence: 0.833\n   Explanation: Despite having no direct coupling dependencies with `Tokenizer.java`, this entity has a strong historical relationship, implying that changes to `Tokenizer.java` may often require corresponding changes in `GlossaryManager.java`.\n\n3. `ChangeUserDictionary.java` - Support: 5, Confidence: 0.833\n   Explanation: Similar to `GlossaryManager.java`, this entity has no direct coupling dependencies but shows a strong co-change pattern, which suggests that changes to `Tokenizer.java` could affect the functionality provided by `ChangeUserDictionary.java`.\n\n4. `EditorSpellChecking.java` - Support: 5, Confidence: 0.833\n   Explanation: With the same level of support and confidence as the previous two files, `EditorSpellChecking.java` is also likely to need synchronization when `Tokenizer.java` is modified due to their historical change patterns.\n\n5. `MatchesTextArea.java` - Support: 4, Confidence: 0.667\n   Explanation: This entity has a slightly lower support and confidence than the top four, but it still appears to be closely related to `Tokenizer.java` based on past modifications, making it a candidate for synchronized changes.\n\n6. `FindMatchesThread.java` - Support: 3, Confidence: 0.5\n   Explanation: Although the confidence is lower compared to the higher-ranked entities, `FindMatchesThread.java` has been changed alongside `Tokenizer.java` three out of six times, indicating some degree of dependency or shared context.\n\n7. `CommandThread.java` - Support: 2, Confidence: 0.333\n   Explanation: With fewer instances of co-changes, `CommandThread.java` is less likely to require synchronized modifications, but given its history, it should still be reviewed when changes are made to `Tokenizer.java`.\n\n8. `StringEntry.java` - Support: 2, Confidence: 0.333\n   Explanation: Like `CommandThread.java`, this entity has been changed together with `Tokenizer.java` two out of six times, so while the likelihood of needing synchronized changes is lower, it's worth considering during modification reviews.\n\nIn conclusion, the most important files to keep in sync with `Tokenizer.java` based on co-change relationships and conceptual coupling include `EditorController.java`, `GlossaryManager.java`, `ChangeUserDictionary.java`, and `EditorSpellChecking.java`. Other entities such as `MatchesTextArea.java`, `FindMatchesThread.java`, `CommandThread.java`, and `StringEntry.java` have weaker but notable connections and should be considered for review during changes to `Tokenizer.java`.",

Furthermore, the conceptual coupling between these two entities is relatively high (0.718), suggesting they share similar responsibilities or are part of the same feature set within the OmegaT project.\n\n2. `GlossaryManager.java` - Support: 5, Confidence: 0.833\n   Explanation: Despite having no direct coupling dependencies with `Tokenizer.java`, this entity has a strong historical relationship, implying that changes to `Tokenizer.java` may often require corresponding changes in `GlossaryManager.java`.\n\n3. `ChangeUserDictionary.java` - Support: 5, Confidence: 0.833\n   Explanation: Similar to `GlossaryManager.java`, this entity has no direct coupling dependencies but shows a strong co-change pattern, which suggests that changes to `Tokenizer.java` could affect the functionality provided by `ChangeUserDictionary.java`.\n\n4. `EditorSpellChecking.java` - Support: 5, Confidence: 0.833\n   Explanation: With the same level of support and confidence as the previous two files, `EditorSpellChecking.java` is also likely to need synchronization when `Tokenizer.java` is modified due to their historical change patterns.\n\n5. `MatchesTextArea.java` - Support: 4, Confidence: 0.667\n   Explanation: This entity has a slightly lower support and confidence than the top four, but it still appears to be closely related to `Tokenizer.java` based on past modifications, making it a candidate for synchronized changes.\n\n6. `FindMatchesThread.java` - Support: 3, Confidence: 0.5\n   Explanation: Although the confidence is lower compared to the higher-ranked entities, `FindMatchesThread.java` has been changed alongside `Tokenizer.java` three out of six times, indicating some degree of dependency or shared context.\n\n7. `CommandThread.java` - Support: 2, Confidence: 0.333\n   Explanation: With fewer instances of co-changes, `CommandThread.java` is less likely to require synchronized modifications, but given its history, it should still be reviewed when changes are made to `Tokenizer.java`.\n\n8. `StringEntry.java` - Support: 2, Confidence: 0.333\n   Explanation: Like `CommandThread.java`, this entity has been changed together with `Tokenizer.java` two out of six times, so while the likelihood of needing synchronized changes is lower, it's worth considering during modification reviews.\n\nIn conclusion, the most important files to keep in sync with `Tokenizer.java` based on co-change relationships and conceptual coupling include `EditorController.java`, `GlossaryManager.java`, `ChangeUserDictionary.java`, and `EditorSpellChecking.java`. Other entities such as `MatchesTextArea.java`, `FindMatchesThread.java`, `CommandThread.java`, and `StringEntry.java` have weaker but notable connections and should be considered for review during changes to `Tokenizer.java`.",

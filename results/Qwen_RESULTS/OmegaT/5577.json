It is also referenced in the call graph from `Google2Translate.java`, which indicates that `BaseTranslate.java` is directly used by `Google2Translate.java`. Furthermore, there's a significant conceptual coupling between the two files, as indicated by a semantic similarity probability of 0.739.

This implies that whenever `Google2Translate.java` was modified, `MyMemoryMachineTranslate.java` was often changed as well. The reason behind this co-change relationship might be due to indirect dependencies or shared functionality within the project.\n\nThe elements in the Change set are sorted in descending order of the likelihood of synchronized modifications.

It is also referenced in the call graph from `Google2Translate.java`, which indicates that `BaseTranslate.java` is directly used by `Google2Translate.java`. Furthermore, there's a significant conceptual coupling between the two files, as indicated by a semantic similarity probability of 0.739. All these factors suggest that changes in `Google2Translate.java` are very likely to require corresponding changes in `BaseTranslate.java`.\n\n- **MyMemoryMachineTranslate.java**: Although there are no direct coupling dependencies or references found between `Google2Translate.java` and `MyMemoryMachineTranslate.java`, they have a perfect co-change relationship (support count 1 and confidence 1.0) according to the project's version history. This implies that whenever `Google2Translate.java` was modified, `MyMemoryMachineTranslate.java` was often changed as well.

This suggests that changes to `ViewLabel.java` will likely require corresponding changes to `ViewParagraph.java` to maintain consistency in the software system's functionality related to these two components. Therefore, `ViewParagraph.java` should be included in the change set and considered for synchronized modifications when `ViewLabel.java` is updated. \n\nSince the initial analysis only provided one entity (`ViewParagraph.java`) with a significant relationship to `ViewLabel.java`, the change set contains only this single entity.

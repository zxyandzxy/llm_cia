Although there are no direct coupling dependencies, the high co-change frequency suggests that changes to `MainWindowMenuHandler.java` will often require corresponding changes in `MainWindowMenu.java`.\n\n2. **SearchWindowController.java**: This entity not only shows a notable co-change relationship (2 supports, 0.08 confidence) but also exhibits method-level coupling dependencies with `MainWindowMenuHandler.java`. Instances of `SearchWindowController` are created and methods are invoked within `MainWindowMenuHandler.java`, indicating that any changes affecting these interactions may necessitate changes in `SearchWindowController.java`.\n\n3. **Preferences.java**: With 3 supports and a confidence level of 0.12, this entity is frequently modified alongside `MainWindowMenuHandler.java`. While no specific code-level coupling was identified, its appearance in the call graph and co-change analysis suggests potential functional dependencies that could warrant synchronization.\n\n4. **GlossaryManager.java**: It appears twice with the target entity during version history analysis, having a confidence of 0.08. Though no explicit coupling dependency information was provided, its presence indicates it might be impacted by changes in `MainWindowMenuHandler.java`.\n\n5. **ProjectUICommands.java**: Similar to `GlossaryManager.java`, this entity has been changed together with `MainWindowMenuHandler.java` twice, giving it a confidence of 0.08. Its inclusion in the call graph reinforces the need for review when changes occur.\n\n6. **FindThread.java**: Also appearing twice in conjunction with `MainWindowMenuHandler.java` (confidence 0.08), this entity should be considered due to its co-change pattern, which hints at related functionality or shared responsibilities.\n\n7. **StatisticsWindow.java**: Appearing once with `MainWindowMenuHandler.java` (confidence 0.04), this entity is included because of its co-change relationship and mention in the call graph, suggesting potential indirect impacts from changes.\n\n8. **EditorSettings.java**: Mentioned once in the co-change list (confidence 0.04) and present in the call graph, this entity might require attention if changes affect settings-related behavior linked to `MainWindowMenuHandler.java`.\n\n9. **MainWindow.java**: With 3 supports and a confidence level of 0.12, this entity has shown up in the co-change analysis. The lower priority here is due to the lack of detailed coupling information, yet its frequent modification alongside `MainWindowMenuHandler.java` warrants consideration.\n\nIn summary, the change set includes entities that have either demonstrated a strong co-change relationship with `MainWindowMenuHandler.java` or have exhibited clear coupling dependencies that indicate they are likely to be affected by changes made to `MainWindowMenuHandler.java`. The ordering reflects the assessed likelihood of needing synchronized modifications, taking into account both statistical evidence from version history and structural dependencies within the codebase.",

Although there are no direct coupling dependencies, the high co-change frequency suggests that changes to `MainWindowMenuHandler.java` will often require corresponding changes in `MainWindowMenu.java`.\n\n2. **SearchWindowController.java**: This entity not only shows a notable co-change relationship (2 supports, 0.08 confidence) but also exhibits method-level coupling dependencies with `MainWindowMenuHandler.java`. Instances of `SearchWindowController` are created and methods are invoked within `MainWindowMenuHandler.java`, indicating that any changes affecting these interactions may necessitate changes in `SearchWindowController.java`.\n\n3. **Preferences.java**: With 3 supports and a confidence level of 0.12, this entity is frequently modified alongside `MainWindowMenuHandler.java`. While no specific code-level coupling was identified, its appearance in the call graph and co-change analysis suggests potential functional dependencies that could warrant synchronization.\n\n4. **GlossaryManager.java**: It appears twice with the target entity during version history analysis, having a confidence of 0.08. Though no explicit coupling dependency information was provided, its presence indicates it might be impacted by changes in `MainWindowMenuHandler.java`.\n\n5. **ProjectUICommands.java**: Similar to `GlossaryManager.java`, this entity has been changed together with `MainWindowMenuHandler.java` twice, giving it a confidence of 0.08. Its inclusion in the call graph reinforces the need for review when changes occur.\n\n6. **FindThread.java**: Also appearing twice in conjunction with `MainWindowMenuHandler.java` (confidence 0.08), this entity should be considered due to its co-change pattern, which hints at related functionality or shared responsibilities.\n\n7. **StatisticsWindow.java**: Appearing once with `MainWindowMenuHandler.java` (confidence 0.04), this entity is included because of its co-change relationship and mention in the call graph, suggesting potential indirect impacts from changes.\n\n8. **EditorSettings.java**: Mentioned once in the co-change list (confidence 0.04) and present in the call graph, this entity might require attention if changes affect settings-related behavior linked to `MainWindowMenuHandler.java`.\n\n9. **MainWindow.java**: With 3 supports and a confidence level of 0.12, this entity has shown up in the co-change analysis. The lower priority here is due to the lack of detailed coupling information, yet its frequent modification alongside `MainWindowMenuHandler.java` warrants consideration.\n\nIn summary, the change set includes entities that have either demonstrated a strong co-change relationship with `MainWindowMenuHandler.java` or have exhibited clear coupling dependencies that indicate they are likely to be affected by changes made to `MainWindowMenuHandler.java`. The ordering reflects the assessed likelihood of needing synchronized modifications, taking into account both statistical evidence from version history and structural dependencies within the codebase.",

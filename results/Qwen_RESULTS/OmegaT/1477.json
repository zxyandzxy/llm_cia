In order to help solve the CIA mission, you should first understand some necessary concepts\uff1a\n(1)entity: Entities represent source code files in CIA tasks, and all the CIA tasks under study are based on the Java language, so entities are files with the .java extension.\n(2)starting entity: The starting entity is also called salient entity, and the salient entity is the root change that causes the modification of the rest of entities in a change set, while the rest of entities are the dependency modification along with the salient one.\nYou will be presented with a starting entity and tools (functions) will be provided to access the more information of the origin system. Your task is to gradually explain which entity really need to be synchronized, based on the starting entity and the information obtained through the function-call. You have 7 chances to call the function to get more information."

Despite no direct coupling dependencies, its high semantic similarity indicates that changes in `Tokenizer.java` are likely to impact `EditorController.java`.\n\n- **GlossaryManager.java**: With the same confidence score as `EditorController.java` (0.833) and an even stronger conceptual coupling (0.853), this entity is highly likely to require synchronized modifications whenever `Tokenizer.java` changes.\n\n- **EditorSpellChecking.java**: It shares the same high co-change confidence score (0.833) with the previous two entities. Although we did not perform additional checks for coupling or conceptual similarity, its historical co-change pattern justifies including it in the change set.\n\n- **ChangeUserDictionary.java**: Similar to `EditorSpellChecking.java`, it has a high co-change confidence score (0.833). Its inclusion is based on the significant likelihood of requiring concurrent modifications with `Tokenizer.java`.\n\n- **MatchesTextArea.java**: With 4 supports and a confidence of 0.667, this entity shows a moderate probability of needing changes alongside `Tokenizer.java`.

Despite no direct coupling dependencies, its high semantic similarity indicates that changes in `Tokenizer.java` are likely to impact `EditorController.java`.\n\n- **GlossaryManager.java**: With the same confidence score as `EditorController.java` (0.833) and an even stronger conceptual coupling (0.853), this entity is highly likely to require synchronized modifications whenever `Tokenizer.java` changes.\n\n- **EditorSpellChecking.java**: It shares the same high co-change confidence score (0.833) with the previous two entities. Although we did not perform additional checks for coupling or conceptual similarity, its historical co-change pattern justifies including it in the change set.\n\n- **ChangeUserDictionary.java**: Similar to `EditorSpellChecking.java`, it has a high co-change confidence score (0.833). Its inclusion is based on the significant likelihood of requiring concurrent modifications with `Tokenizer.java`.\n\n- **MatchesTextArea.java**: With 4 supports and a confidence of 0.667, this entity shows a moderate probability of needing changes alongside `Tokenizer.java`.

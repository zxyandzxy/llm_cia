Although there are no direct coupling dependencies between them, they exhibit a strong conceptual coupling with a semantic similarity score of 0.887. This high degree of conceptual relatedness implies that these two entities are likely to be involved in similar or interconnected functionalities within the project. Therefore, changes in `TaasExtractionResult.java` are very likely to necessitate corresponding adjustments in `ObjectFactory.java`.\n\n2. **TaaSClient.java**: Similar to `ObjectFactory.java`, `TaaSClient.java` has been identified as frequently modified alongside `TaasExtractionResult.java`. Despite the absence of coupling dependencies, the conceptual coupling score of 0.739 suggests that these two files share a notable amount of common functionality or context. While this connection is not as strong as with `ObjectFactory.java`, it still indicates a significant likelihood that changes to `TaasExtractionResult.java` may require concurrent changes in `TaaSClient.java`.\n\nIn conclusion, based on their co-change history and conceptual coupling, it is recommended to synchronize changes with both `ObjectFactory.java` and `TaaSClient.java` when modifying `TaasExtractionResult.java`, prioritizing `ObjectFactory.java` due to its higher conceptual similarity.",

Although there are no direct coupling dependencies between them, they exhibit a strong conceptual coupling with a semantic similarity score of 0.887. This high degree of conceptual relatedness implies that these two entities are likely to be involved in similar or interconnected functionalities within the project. Therefore, changes in `TaasExtractionResult.java` are very likely to necessitate corresponding adjustments in `ObjectFactory.java`.\n\n2. **TaaSClient.java**: Similar to `ObjectFactory.java`, `TaaSClient.java` has been identified as frequently modified alongside `TaasExtractionResult.java`. Despite the absence of coupling dependencies, the conceptual coupling score of 0.739 suggests that these two files share a notable amount of common functionality or context. While this connection is not as strong as with `ObjectFactory.java`, it still indicates a significant likelihood that changes to `TaasExtractionResult.java` may require concurrent changes in `TaaSClient.java`.\n\nIn conclusion, based on their co-change history and conceptual coupling, it is recommended to synchronize changes with both `ObjectFactory.java` and `TaaSClient.java` when modifying `TaasExtractionResult.java`, prioritizing `ObjectFactory.java` due to its higher conceptual similarity.",

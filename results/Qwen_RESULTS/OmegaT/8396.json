The method `getGlossary` returns an instance of `GlossaryTextArea`, and it is also used directly within the `initializeGUI` method. Changes to `Core.java` that affect this interaction will likely require changes to `GlossaryTextArea.java`.\n\n2. **MainWindowMenuHandler**: Although there are no direct coupling dependencies found between `Core.java` and `MainWindowMenuHandler.java`, they have a co-change relationship with 4 supports and a confidence of 0.286. This suggests that when changes occur in `Core.java`, `MainWindowMenuHandler.java` may often need updates due to related functionality or indirect dependencies.\n\n3. **Main**: Similar to `MainWindowMenuHandler.java`, there are no direct coupling dependencies detected between `Core.java` and `Main.java`. However, with 3 supports and a confidence of 0.214, `Main.java` is frequently modified alongside `Core.java`, possibly due to its central role in the application's startup process or integration points with `Core.java`.\n\n4. **MainWindowMenu**: Like other entities listed above, there are no direct coupling dependencies found. It has been changed together with `Core.java` 3 times out of 8, making it a potential candidate for needing synchronization if changes affect menu-related behaviors or integrations.\n\n5. **TestCore**: This test class has been co-changed with `Core.java` twice, indicating a possible need for updating tests when `Core.java` is modified. However, since it's a test class, it might not be as critical unless the changes impact core functionalities tested by `TestCore`.\n\n6. **LanguageToolWrapper**: With 2 supports and a confidence of 0.143, this entity shows some correlation with `Core.java` changes, suggesting that it might require updates in conjunction with changes affecting language processing features.\n\n7. **CommentsTextArea**: Co-changed twice with `Core.java`, it might be necessary to update this entity when changes relate to comments or text area interactions within the core system.\n\n8. **SearchWindowTest**: Having a support count of 2 and a confidence of 0.143, this test file could need synchronization to ensure that search window functionality remains consistent with changes made to `Core.java`.\n\n9. **TransTipsMarker**: Also co-changed twice with `Core.java`, this entity might involve changes to translation tips or markers, which can be influenced by modifications to core functionalities.\n\n10. **GlossaryTextAreaTest**: Lastly, with 2 supports and a confidence of 0.143, this test class is included due to its association with `GlossaryTextArea`, which we've already identified as having significant coupling dependencies with `Core.java`.\n\nIn conclusion, while some entities like `GlossaryTextArea` show clear reasons for synchronization through coupling dependencies, others rely on historical co-change patterns. These relationships indicate that these entities should be considered for synchronization when changes are made to `Core.java`.",

The method `getGlossary` returns an instance of `GlossaryTextArea`, and it is also used directly within the `initializeGUI` method. Changes to `Core.java` that affect this interaction will likely require changes to `GlossaryTextArea.java`.\n\n2. **MainWindowMenuHandler**: Although there are no direct coupling dependencies found between `Core.java` and `MainWindowMenuHandler.java`, they have a co-change relationship with 4 supports and a confidence of 0.286. This suggests that when changes occur in `Core.java`, `MainWindowMenuHandler.java` may often need updates due to related functionality or indirect dependencies.\n\n3. **Main**: Similar to `MainWindowMenuHandler.java`, there are no direct coupling dependencies detected between `Core.java` and `Main.java`. However, with 3 supports and a confidence of 0.214, `Main.java` is frequently modified alongside `Core.java`, possibly due to its central role in the application's startup process or integration points with `Core.java`.\n\n4. **MainWindowMenu**: Like other entities listed above, there are no direct coupling dependencies found. It has been changed together with `Core.java` 3 times out of 8, making it a potential candidate for needing synchronization if changes affect menu-related behaviors or integrations.\n\n5. **TestCore**: This test class has been co-changed with `Core.java` twice, indicating a possible need for updating tests when `Core.java` is modified. However, since it's a test class, it might not be as critical unless the changes impact core functionalities tested by `TestCore`.\n\n6. **LanguageToolWrapper**: With 2 supports and a confidence of 0.143, this entity shows some correlation with `Core.java` changes, suggesting that it might require updates in conjunction with changes affecting language processing features.\n\n7. **CommentsTextArea**: Co-changed twice with `Core.java`, it might be necessary to update this entity when changes relate to comments or text area interactions within the core system.\n\n8. **SearchWindowTest**: Having a support count of 2 and a confidence of 0.143, this test file could need synchronization to ensure that search window functionality remains consistent with changes made to `Core.java`.\n\n9. **TransTipsMarker**: Also co-changed twice with `Core.java`, this entity might involve changes to translation tips or markers, which can be influenced by modifications to core functionalities.\n\n10. **GlossaryTextAreaTest**: Lastly, with 2 supports and a confidence of 0.143, this test class is included due to its association with `GlossaryTextArea`, which we've already identified as having significant coupling dependencies with `Core.java`.\n\nIn conclusion, while some entities like `GlossaryTextArea` show clear reasons for synchronization through coupling dependencies, others rely on historical co-change patterns. These relationships indicate that these entities should be considered for synchronization when changes are made to `Core.java`.",

Furthermore, there is a strong conceptual coupling (0.776) between these two entities, indicating that they share common functionality or purpose. Changes in `GlossaryEntry.java` should prompt a review and potential modification of `FindGlossaryThread.java`.\n\n2. **GlossaryTextArea.java**: With the same support count and confidence as `FindGlossaryThread.java`, this entity also has a very high conceptual coupling (0.806) with `GlossaryEntry.java`. The shared domain and purpose suggest that changes to `GlossaryEntry.java` will likely require corresponding adjustments in `GlossaryTextArea.java`.\n\n3. **GlossaryManager.java**: This entity has been changed in 2 out of 3 modifications involving `GlossaryEntry.java`, resulting in a confidence level of 0.67. While we do not have direct evidence of coupling or call dependencies, its frequent co-change relationship suggests that it plays a role in managing glossaries which could be affected by changes in `GlossaryEntry.java`.\n\n4. **GlossaryEntryTest.java**: With a confidence level of 0.67, this test class is closely related to `GlossaryEntry.java`. As tests often need to be updated to reflect changes in the tested code, any modifications in `GlossaryEntry.java` should be accompanied by updates to `GlossaryEntryTest.java`.\n\n5. **GlossaryAutoCompleterView.java**: Although only appearing once in the version history alongside `GlossaryEntry.java`, this entity still shares a conceptual domain with `GlossaryEntry.java`. It's reasonable to expect that changes in glossary entries may affect how they're displayed in an auto-completer view.\n\n6. **IDataEngine.java**: This entity appeared once with a confidence level of 0.33. Given the lower confidence, the need for synchronization is less certain. However, due to its probable role in data handling within the application, it might still require attention when `GlossaryEntry.java` is modified.\n\n7. **CommandThread.java**: Similarly to `IDataEngine.java`, `CommandThread.java` has a low confidence level of 0.33. Its inclusion in the change set is based on the co-change relationship, but the lack of other supporting evidence means it's less likely to need changes compared to higher-ranked entities.\n\nIn summary, while some entities have stronger indications of needing synchronized changes with `GlossaryEntry.java` than others, all listed entities should be reviewed during the modification process to ensure the integrity and consistency of the OmegaT project.",

Furthermore, there is a strong conceptual coupling (0.776) between these two entities, indicating that they share common functionality or purpose. Changes in `GlossaryEntry.java` should prompt a review and potential modification of `FindGlossaryThread.java`.\n\n2. **GlossaryTextArea.java**: With the same support count and confidence as `FindGlossaryThread.java`, this entity also has a very high conceptual coupling (0.806) with `GlossaryEntry.java`. The shared domain and purpose suggest that changes to `GlossaryEntry.java` will likely require corresponding adjustments in `GlossaryTextArea.java`.\n\n3. **GlossaryManager.java**: This entity has been changed in 2 out of 3 modifications involving `GlossaryEntry.java`, resulting in a confidence level of 0.67. While we do not have direct evidence of coupling or call dependencies, its frequent co-change relationship suggests that it plays a role in managing glossaries which could be affected by changes in `GlossaryEntry.java`.\n\n4. **GlossaryEntryTest.java**: With a confidence level of 0.67, this test class is closely related to `GlossaryEntry.java`. As tests often need to be updated to reflect changes in the tested code, any modifications in `GlossaryEntry.java` should be accompanied by updates to `GlossaryEntryTest.java`.\n\n5. **GlossaryAutoCompleterView.java**: Although only appearing once in the version history alongside `GlossaryEntry.java`, this entity still shares a conceptual domain with `GlossaryEntry.java`. It's reasonable to expect that changes in glossary entries may affect how they're displayed in an auto-completer view.\n\n6. **IDataEngine.java**: This entity appeared once with a confidence level of 0.33. Given the lower confidence, the need for synchronization is less certain. However, due to its probable role in data handling within the application, it might still require attention when `GlossaryEntry.java` is modified.\n\n7. **CommandThread.java**: Similarly to `IDataEngine.java`, `CommandThread.java` has a low confidence level of 0.33. Its inclusion in the change set is based on the co-change relationship, but the lack of other supporting evidence means it's less likely to need changes compared to higher-ranked entities.\n\nIn summary, while some entities have stronger indications of needing synchronized changes with `GlossaryEntry.java` than others, all listed entities should be reviewed during the modification process to ensure the integrity and consistency of the OmegaT project.",

The perfect confidence level indicates a consistent pattern of co-changes, which means that any modifications in `Rule.java` are likely to necessitate changes in `MapRule.java`.\n\n2. **SRX.java**:\n   - Co-change relationship support count: 1\n   - Confidence level: 1.0 (indicating that every time `Rule.java` was changed, so was `SRX.java`)\n   - Conceptual coupling probability: 0.855 (strong semantic similarity)\n\n   Similar to `MapRule.java`, `SRX.java` does not have direct coupling dependencies or call graph relationships with `Rule.java`. However, it has a strong conceptual relationship and a perfect confidence level for co-changes. This implies that `SRX.java` should be reviewed and potentially updated whenever `Rule.java` undergoes modifications.\n\nThe elements in the Change set are sorted in descending order of the likelihood of synchronized modifications based on the conceptual coupling probabilities. Although both entities have the same confidence level for co-changes, `MapRule.java` has a slightly higher conceptual similarity with `Rule.java`, making it marginally more likely to require synchronized changes.

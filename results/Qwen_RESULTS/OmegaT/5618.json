Although `FindMatchesThread.java` and `CalcMatchStatistics.java` have been frequently changed together with `FindMatches.java`, the lack of detected coupling dependencies suggests that their co-change might be due to other factors not captured by our current analysis, such as shared project requirements or broader architectural changes within the system.\n\nFor further investigation, if more function calls were available, we could look into other types of relationships or analyze additional files that might provide insight into why `FindMatchesThread.java` and `CalcMatchStatistics.java` are often changed together with `FindMatches.java`. \n\nHowever, based on the provided information, the entities that really need to be synchronized with `FindMatches.java` are `IStopped.java` and `ExternalTMX.java`.",

Despite there being no detected coupling dependencies, the high confidence level indicates a strong historical relationship suggesting that changes to `FindMatches.java` may necessitate changes to `FindMatchesThread.java`.\n\n2. **CalcMatchStatistics.java**: Similar to `FindMatchesThread.java`, this entity also has a confidence level of 1.0, having been co-changed three times. There is no detected coupling between the two, but the consistent co-change history suggests that they are likely to be modified together.\n\n3. **IStopped.java**: This entity appears directly in the call graph for `FindMatches.java` and has a support count of 1 with a confidence level of 0.33. The direct usage within `FindMatches.java` implies that any changes to `FindMatches.java` could impact `IStopped.java`.\n\n4. **ExternalTMX.java**: This entity is also called by `FindMatches.java` and shares a similar co-change pattern with `IStopped.java`. It has been co-changed once, with a confidence level of 0.33. The direct interaction makes it necessary to consider changes to `ExternalTMX.java` when modifying `FindMatches.java`.\n\n5. **Statistics.java**: Although not found in the call graph or showing coupling dependencies, this entity has been co-changed once with `FindMatches.java`, resulting in a confidence level of 0.33. While less likely to require synchronization compared to the higher-ranked entities, its co-change history still suggests some potential interdependencies.\n\n6. **TMXReader2.java**: Like `Statistics.java`, this entity has been co-changed once with a confidence level of 0.33. It does not appear in the call graph nor show coupling dependencies, but due to its co-change history, it is included in the change set as a precautionary measure.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the co-change analysis, `FindMatchesThread.java` and `CalcMatchStatistics.java` should be prioritized for synchronized changes with `FindMatches.java` due to their strong co-change correlation. However, `IStopped.java` and `ExternalTMX.java` must also be considered due to their direct interaction with `FindMatches.java`. Lastly, while less likely, `Statistics.java` and `TMXReader2.java` should not be entirely discounted given their historical co-change patterns.",

Although `FindMatchesThread.java` and `CalcMatchStatistics.java` have been frequently changed together with `FindMatches.java`, the lack of detected coupling dependencies suggests that their co-change might be due to other factors not captured by our current analysis, such as shared project requirements or broader architectural changes within the system.\n\nFor further investigation, if more function calls were available, we could look into other types of relationships or analyze additional files that might provide insight into why `FindMatchesThread.java` and `CalcMatchStatistics.java` are often changed together with `FindMatches.java`. \n\nHowever, based on the provided information, the entities that really need to be synchronized with `FindMatches.java` are `IStopped.java` and `ExternalTMX.java`.",

Despite there being no detected coupling dependencies, the high confidence level indicates a strong historical relationship suggesting that changes to `FindMatches.java` may necessitate changes to `FindMatchesThread.java`.\n\n2. **CalcMatchStatistics.java**: Similar to `FindMatchesThread.java`, this entity also has a confidence level of 1.0, having been co-changed three times. There is no detected coupling between the two, but the consistent co-change history suggests that they are likely to be modified together.\n\n3. **IStopped.java**: This entity appears directly in the call graph for `FindMatches.java` and has a support count of 1 with a confidence level of 0.33. The direct usage within `FindMatches.java` implies that any changes to `FindMatches.java` could impact `IStopped.java`.\n\n4. **ExternalTMX.java**: This entity is also called by `FindMatches.java` and shares a similar co-change pattern with `IStopped.java`. It has been co-changed once, with a confidence level of 0.33. The direct interaction makes it necessary to consider changes to `ExternalTMX.java` when modifying `FindMatches.java`.\n\n5. **Statistics.java**: Although not found in the call graph or showing coupling dependencies, this entity has been co-changed once with `FindMatches.java`, resulting in a confidence level of 0.33. While less likely to require synchronization compared to the higher-ranked entities, its co-change history still suggests some potential interdependencies.\n\n6. **TMXReader2.java**: Like `Statistics.java`, this entity has been co-changed once with a confidence level of 0.33. It does not appear in the call graph nor show coupling dependencies, but due to its co-change history, it is included in the change set as a precautionary measure.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the co-change analysis, `FindMatchesThread.java` and `CalcMatchStatistics.java` should be prioritized for synchronized changes with `FindMatches.java` due to their strong co-change correlation. However, `IStopped.java` and `ExternalTMX.java` must also be considered due to their direct interaction with `FindMatches.java`. Lastly, while less likely, `Statistics.java` and `TMXReader2.java` should not be entirely discounted given their historical co-change patterns.",

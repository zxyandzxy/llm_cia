Although there are no direct coupling dependencies, changes to `Core.java` should be synchronized with this entity due to their historical co-modification patterns and semantic similarity.\n  \n- **MainWindowMenu**: With a confidence level of 0.2143, this entity is also highly likely to change alongside `Core.java`. It's part of the same user interface context as `MainWindowMenuHandler`, which further supports the need for synchronization.\n\n- **GlossaryTextArea**: This entity appears both in the co-change results and the call graph from `Core.java`, suggesting that it is directly used or interacted with by `Core.java`. Changes to `Core.java` might necessitate adjustments in `GlossaryTextArea`.\n\n- **Main**: The confidence level for `Main.java` is 0.2143, indicating a significant chance of being modified when `Core.java` is changed. Given its central role in any application, keeping `Main.java` in sync with `Core.java` could be crucial.\n\n- **EditorController**: This entity was identified in the call graph of `Core.java`, meaning `Core.java` depends on it either through method calls or variable references. Synchronizing changes ensures that modifications do not break the interaction between these entities.\n\n- **TestCore**: With a confidence level of 0.1429, this test entity is often changed alongside `Core.java`. Keeping tests updated with the code they verify is important for maintaining effective unit testing coverage.\n\n- **PluginUtils**: This entity shows up in the co-change list with a confidence of 0.1429, implying a moderate likelihood of needing synchronization. Its purpose suggests it may provide utility functions related to plugin management that could be affected by core system changes.\n\n- **CommentsTextArea**: Appears in the co-change list with a confidence level of 0.1429. It might be closely associated with functionalities provided or utilized by `Core.java`.\n\n- **LanguageToolWrapper**: Has a confidence of 0.1429, and considering its role, it may need to be adjusted if language processing features in `Core.java` are modified.\n\n- **SearchWindowTest**: This test file has been modified along with `Core.java` before, with a confidence of 0.1429. Keeping it in sync helps ensure the search functionality remains reliable when changes are made to the core system.\n\nThe elements in the Change set are sorted in descending order of the likelihood of synchronized modifications based on the analysis performed using the provided tools.",

Although there are no direct coupling dependencies, changes to `Core.java` should be synchronized with this entity due to their historical co-modification patterns and semantic similarity.\n  \n- **MainWindowMenu**: With a confidence level of 0.2143, this entity is also highly likely to change alongside `Core.java`. It's part of the same user interface context as `MainWindowMenuHandler`, which further supports the need for synchronization.\n\n- **GlossaryTextArea**: This entity appears both in the co-change results and the call graph from `Core.java`, suggesting that it is directly used or interacted with by `Core.java`. Changes to `Core.java` might necessitate adjustments in `GlossaryTextArea`.\n\n- **Main**: The confidence level for `Main.java` is 0.2143, indicating a significant chance of being modified when `Core.java` is changed. Given its central role in any application, keeping `Main.java` in sync with `Core.java` could be crucial.\n\n- **EditorController**: This entity was identified in the call graph of `Core.java`, meaning `Core.java` depends on it either through method calls or variable references. Synchronizing changes ensures that modifications do not break the interaction between these entities.\n\n- **TestCore**: With a confidence level of 0.1429, this test entity is often changed alongside `Core.java`. Keeping tests updated with the code they verify is important for maintaining effective unit testing coverage.\n\n- **PluginUtils**: This entity shows up in the co-change list with a confidence of 0.1429, implying a moderate likelihood of needing synchronization. Its purpose suggests it may provide utility functions related to plugin management that could be affected by core system changes.\n\n- **CommentsTextArea**: Appears in the co-change list with a confidence level of 0.1429. It might be closely associated with functionalities provided or utilized by `Core.java`.\n\n- **LanguageToolWrapper**: Has a confidence of 0.1429, and considering its role, it may need to be adjusted if language processing features in `Core.java` are modified.\n\n- **SearchWindowTest**: This test file has been modified along with `Core.java` before, with a confidence of 0.1429.

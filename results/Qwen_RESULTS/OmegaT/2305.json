Therefore, `EditorController` should definitely be synchronized when `Core.java` is modified.\n\nAdditionally, based on the previous co-change analysis and call graph, we also found that `GlossaryTextArea` and `SpellChecker` are frequently changed alongside `Core.java` and are directly called by `Core.java`. This suggests that these entities should also be considered for synchronization.\n\nTo summarize, the entities that should be synchronized with `Core.java` include:\n- `EditorController`\n- `GlossaryTextArea`\n- `SpellChecker`\n\nThese conclusions are supported by both historical co-change patterns and direct code dependencies.

Therefore, it's critical for synchronization due to both historical patterns and code dependencies.\n\n5. **LanguageToolWrapper**: It appeared twice in the co-change analysis (support: 2, confidence: 0.143).

Specifically, there is a direct usage of an instance of `EditorController` in the `initialize` method at line 132 within `Core.java`.\n\nGiven this direct coupling, it's clear that changes to `Core.java` could have implications for `EditorController`, as they are tightly coupled. Therefore, `EditorController` should definitely be synchronized when `Core.java` is modified.\n\nAdditionally, based on the previous co-change analysis and call graph, we also found that `GlossaryTextArea` and `SpellChecker` are frequently changed alongside `Core.java` and are directly called by `Core.java`. This suggests that these entities should also be considered for synchronization.\n\nTo summarize, the entities that should be synchronized with `Core.java` include:\n- `EditorController`\n- `GlossaryTextArea`\n- `SpellChecker`\n\nThese conclusions are supported by both historical co-change patterns and direct code dependencies. If you agree with this assessment, the next step would be to review these files for any necessary changes whenever `Core.java` is updated. \n\nWould you like to investigate further with another specific entity or do you consider this task completed?",

Therefore, it's critical for synchronization due to both historical patterns and code dependencies.\n\n5. **LanguageToolWrapper**: It appeared twice in the co-change analysis (support: 2, confidence: 0.143).

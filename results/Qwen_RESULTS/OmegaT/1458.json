The high frequency and confidence indicate a strong relationship where changes in `Tokenizer.java` often require corresponding changes in `EditorController.java`.\n\n2. **GlossaryManager.java**: Similar to `EditorController.java`, this entity has also been modified together with `Tokenizer.java` 5 times out of 6, giving it a confidence level of 0.833. It is highly likely that any changes affecting `Tokenizer.java` will have implications for `GlossaryManager.java`.\n\n3. **EditorSpellChecking.java**: With the same confidence as the previous two entities (0.833), this file has shown a pattern of co-change with `Tokenizer.java`. Thus, it should be considered for synchronization whenever `Tokenizer.java` undergoes modification.\n\n4. **MatchesTextArea.java**: Appearing in 4 out of 6 changes related to `Tokenizer.java`, with a confidence of 0.667, this entity shows a moderate to high probability of needing updates when `Tokenizer.java` is changed.\n\n5. **FindMatchesThread.java**: This entity has been involved in 3 out of 6 changes involving `Tokenizer.java`, resulting in a confidence level of 0.5. Although its confidence is lower than the top four entities, it still suggests a significant likelihood of requiring synchronized modifications.\n\n6. **StaticUtils.java**: Co-changed once with `Tokenizer.java`, with a confidence of 0.167. While this entity has the lowest support and confidence, it is included due to its past association with `Tokenizer.java`.\n\n7. **CommandThread.java**: Like `StaticUtils.java`, this entity has a support of 1 and a confidence of 0.167. Its inclusion in the change set is based on historical co-change patterns, albeit with low confidence.\n\nIn summary, the first four entities (`EditorController.java`, `GlossaryManager.java`, `EditorSpellChecking.java`, and `MatchesTextArea.java`) exhibit stronger evidence for synchronization due to their higher frequencies of co-change and confidence levels.

The high frequency and confidence indicate a strong relationship where changes in `Tokenizer.java` often require corresponding changes in `EditorController.java`.\n\n2. **GlossaryManager.java**: Similar to `EditorController.java`, this entity has also been modified together with `Tokenizer.java` 5 times out of 6, giving it a confidence level of 0.833. It is highly likely that any changes affecting `Tokenizer.java` will have implications for `GlossaryManager.java`.\n\n3. **EditorSpellChecking.java**: With the same confidence as the previous two entities (0.833), this file has shown a pattern of co-change with `Tokenizer.java`. Thus, it should be considered for synchronization whenever `Tokenizer.java` undergoes modification.\n\n4. **MatchesTextArea.java**: Appearing in 4 out of 6 changes related to `Tokenizer.java`, with a confidence of 0.667, this entity shows a moderate to high probability of needing updates when `Tokenizer.java` is changed.\n\n5. **FindMatchesThread.java**: This entity has been involved in 3 out of 6 changes involving `Tokenizer.java`, resulting in a confidence level of 0.5. Although its confidence is lower than the top four entities, it still suggests a significant likelihood of requiring synchronized modifications.\n\n6. **StaticUtils.java**: Co-changed once with `Tokenizer.java`, with a confidence of 0.167. While this entity has the lowest support and confidence, it is included due to its past association with `Tokenizer.java`.\n\n7. **CommandThread.java**: Like `StaticUtils.java`, this entity has a support of 1 and a confidence of 0.167. Its inclusion in the change set is based on historical co-change patterns, albeit with low confidence.\n\nIn summary, the first four entities (`EditorController.java`, `GlossaryManager.java`, `EditorSpellChecking.java`, and `MatchesTextArea.java`) exhibit stronger evidence for synchronization due to their higher frequencies of co-change and confidence levels.

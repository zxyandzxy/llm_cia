This suggests that changes to `MainWindowMenuHandler.java` often require corresponding adjustments in `MainWindowMenu.java`. It's likely due to their functional relationship within the user interface structure of the application.\n\n2. **Preferences**:\n   - Support count: 3\n   - Confidence level: 0.12\n   There are no direct coupling dependencies found between `MainWindowMenuHandler.java` and `Preferences.java`. However, given the co-change pattern, it's important to review `Preferences.java` when changes are made to `MainWindowMenuHandler.java` as there is a notable chance that settings or configurations managed by `Preferences.java` might be affected.\n\n3. **MainWindow**:\n   - Support count: 3\n   - Confidence level: 0.12\n   While `MainWindow.java` has a similar support count and confidence level to `Preferences.java`, it also appears in the call graph for `MainWindowMenuHandler.java`. This indicates that `MainWindow.java` may directly interact with `MainWindowMenuHandler.java` and thus should be reviewed for potential necessary changes.\n\n4. **StatisticsWindow**:\n   - Support count: 1\n   - Confidence level: 0.04\n   Although `StatisticsWindow.java` has a lower support count and confidence level compared to the top three entities, it is included in both the co-change results and the call graph. Therefore, it's prudent to check this file for any required modifications when working on `MainWindowMenuHandler.java`.\n\n5. **EditorSettings**:\n   - Support count: 1\n   - Confidence level: 0.04\n   Similar to `StatisticsWindow.java`, `EditorSettings.java` has a low support count and confidence but is present in the call graph. Since `MainWindowMenuHandler.java` interacts with it, changes could potentially impact editor-related settings, necessitating a review.\n\nIn summary, the change set is ordered based on the combined analysis of co-change relationships and the call graph, prioritizing those files most likely to require synchronized changes with `MainWindowMenuHandler.java`.",

This suggests that changes to `MainWindowMenuHandler.java` often require corresponding adjustments in `MainWindowMenu.java`. It's likely due to their functional relationship within the user interface structure of the application.\n\n2. **Preferences**:\n   - Support count: 3\n   - Confidence level: 0.12\n   There are no direct coupling dependencies found between `MainWindowMenuHandler.java` and `Preferences.java`. However, given the co-change pattern, it's important to review `Preferences.java` when changes are made to `MainWindowMenuHandler.java` as there is a notable chance that settings or configurations managed by `Preferences.java` might be affected.\n\n3. **MainWindow**:\n   - Support count: 3\n   - Confidence level: 0.12\n   While `MainWindow.java` has a similar support count and confidence level to `Preferences.java`, it also appears in the call graph for `MainWindowMenuHandler.java`. This indicates that `MainWindow.java` may directly interact with `MainWindowMenuHandler.java` and thus should be reviewed for potential necessary changes.\n\n4. **StatisticsWindow**:\n   - Support count: 1\n   - Confidence level: 0.04\n   Although `StatisticsWindow.java` has a lower support count and confidence level compared to the top three entities, it is included in both the co-change results and the call graph. Therefore, it's prudent to check this file for any required modifications when working on `MainWindowMenuHandler.java`.\n\n5. **EditorSettings**:\n   - Support count: 1\n   - Confidence level: 0.04\n   Similar to `StatisticsWindow.java`, `EditorSettings.java` has a low support count and confidence but is present in the call graph. Since `MainWindowMenuHandler.java` interacts with it, changes could potentially impact editor-related settings, necessitating a review.\n\nIn summary, the change set is ordered based on the combined analysis of co-change relationships and the call graph, prioritizing those files most likely to require synchronized changes with `MainWindowMenuHandler.java`.",

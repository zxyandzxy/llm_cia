Furthermore, there is a coupling dependency indicating that `EditorController` implements the `IEditor` interface. Changes in `IEditor` would require corresponding changes in `EditorController`, making it the most likely candidate for synchronized modifications.\n\n- **MainWindowMenuHandler**: This entity has been changed alongside `IEditor` 13 times out of 19 possible, resulting in a confidence score of 0.6842105263157895. Although we don't have detailed information about its relationship with `IEditor`, the high support and confidence suggest a strong correlation requiring synchronization when changes are made to `IEditor`.\n\n- **MainWindowMenu**: Similar to `MainWindowMenuHandler`, this entity also shows up 8 times with a confidence of 0.42105263157894735. Given its frequent co-changes, it's reasonable to consider that it might be dependent on `IEditor` through interactions or shared functionality.\n\n- **MainWindow**: With a confidence score of 0.21052631578947367 and 4 instances of co-change, `MainWindow` appears less frequently but still indicates a likelihood of needing synchronized changes due to potential dependencies or interaction with `IEditor`.\n\n- **EditorTextArea**: This entity has been modified together with `IEditor` twice, giving a confidence score of 0.10526315789473684. It may share responsibilities or features with `IEditor` which could necessitate changes if `IEditor` is altered.\n\n- **MatchesTextArea**: Like `EditorTextArea`, this entity also shares two co-changes with `IEditor`, suggesting a need for synchronization though the confidence score is relatively low (0.10526315789473684).\n\n- **SearchWindowTest**: This test class has appeared four times in co-changes with `IEditor`, resulting in a confidence score of 0.21052631578947367. Tests often need to be updated to reflect changes in the classes they test, so this entity should be considered for synchronization.\n\n- **GlossaryTextAreaTest**: Another test class with a high number of co-changes (13), and a confidence score of 0.6842105263157895. Despite being a test, its significant co-change frequency suggests that it closely follows changes in `IEditor` and should be synchronized accordingly.\n\nThe elements in the Change set are sorted in descending order of the likelihood of synchronized modifications based on the provided data and analysis. The first four entities are more likely to require synchronization due to their higher confidence scores and identified relationships, while the remaining test classes follow based on their respective co-change frequencies.",

Furthermore, there is a coupling dependency indicating that `EditorController` implements the `IEditor` interface. Changes in `IEditor` would require corresponding changes in `EditorController`, making it the most likely candidate for synchronized modifications.\n\n- **MainWindowMenuHandler**: This entity has been changed alongside `IEditor` 13 times out of 19 possible, resulting in a confidence score of 0.6842105263157895. Although we don't have detailed information about its relationship with `IEditor`, the high support and confidence suggest a strong correlation requiring synchronization when changes are made to `IEditor`.\n\n- **MainWindowMenu**: Similar to `MainWindowMenuHandler`, this entity also shows up 8 times with a confidence of 0.42105263157894735. Given its frequent co-changes, it's reasonable to consider that it might be dependent on `IEditor` through interactions or shared functionality.\n\n- **MainWindow**: With a confidence score of 0.21052631578947367 and 4 instances of co-change, `MainWindow` appears less frequently but still indicates a likelihood of needing synchronized changes due to potential dependencies or interaction with `IEditor`.\n\n- **EditorTextArea**: This entity has been modified together with `IEditor` twice, giving a confidence score of 0.10526315789473684. It may share responsibilities or features with `IEditor` which could necessitate changes if `IEditor` is altered.\n\n- **MatchesTextArea**: Like `EditorTextArea`, this entity also shares two co-changes with `IEditor`, suggesting a need for synchronization though the confidence score is relatively low (0.10526315789473684).\n\n- **SearchWindowTest**: This test class has appeared four times in co-changes with `IEditor`, resulting in a confidence score of 0.21052631578947367. Tests often need to be updated to reflect changes in the classes they test, so this entity should be considered for synchronization.\n\n- **GlossaryTextAreaTest**: Another test class with a high number of co-changes (13), and a confidence score of 0.6842105263157895. Despite being a test, its significant co-change frequency suggests that it closely follows changes in `IEditor` and should be synchronized accordingly.\n\nThe elements in the Change set are sorted in descending order of the likelihood of synchronized modifications based on the provided data and analysis. The first four entities are more likely to require synchronization due to their higher confidence scores and identified relationships, while the remaining test classes follow based on their respective co-change frequencies.",

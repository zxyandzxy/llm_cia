Any changes to the parent class (`InternetSearchPlugin`) may necessitate corresponding changes in this child class to maintain consistency and avoid potential issues such as method overriding or missing implementations. The confidence level is 1.0, indicating that whenever `InternetSearchPlugin.java` was changed, `WikipediaInternetSearchPlugin.java` was also modified.\n\n2. **`InternetSearchPanel.java`**: This entity shows a strong correlation with `InternetSearchPlugin.java`, having a confidence level of 1.0. It suggests that when modifications were made to `InternetSearchPlugin.java`, `InternetSearchPanel.java` was often changed simultaneously. While there are no coupling dependencies found between them, their co-change history indicates they should be considered together for synchronization.\n\n3. **`OpenSearchPlugin.java`**: Although it shares a high confidence level (1.0) with `InternetSearchPlugin.java`, our analysis revealed that this entity has been removed from the project due to version iteration. Despite its removal, if any legacy code still references `OpenSearchPlugin.java`, it would need to be addressed during synchronization efforts.\n\n4. **`OpenSearchDescription.java`**: This entity has been co-changed with `InternetSearchPlugin.java` once, resulting in a lower confidence level of 0.5. While not as strongly correlated as the first two entities, it still holds relevance due to its co-change history and should be reviewed for possible synchronization.\n\n5. **`InternetSearchAction.java`**: Similar to `OpenSearchDescription.java`, this entity has a low support count and confidence level of 0.5. Its inclusion in the change set is based on historical co-change patterns, suggesting that it might require attention during the modification of `InternetSearchPlugin.java`.\n\n6. **`UninstallOpenSearchPluginAction.java`**: With only one support and a confidence level of 0.5, this entity ranks last in the change set. Its co-change occurrence with `InternetSearchPlugin.java` is relatively weak; however, given the limited information, it is prudent to include it for review to ensure comprehensive coverage of all potentially impacted areas.\n\nIn summary, these entities are recommended for synchronized changes with `InternetSearchPlugin.java` based on their co-change history and coupling relationships, ensuring the overall stability and functionality of the software system.",

Any changes to the parent class (`InternetSearchPlugin`) may necessitate corresponding changes in this child class to maintain consistency and avoid potential issues such as method overriding or missing implementations. The confidence level is 1.0, indicating that whenever `InternetSearchPlugin.java` was changed, `WikipediaInternetSearchPlugin.java` was also modified.\n\n2. **`InternetSearchPanel.java`**: This entity shows a strong correlation with `InternetSearchPlugin.java`, having a confidence level of 1.0. It suggests that when modifications were made to `InternetSearchPlugin.java`, `InternetSearchPanel.java` was often changed simultaneously. While there are no coupling dependencies found between them, their co-change history indicates they should be considered together for synchronization.\n\n3. **`OpenSearchPlugin.java`**: Although it shares a high confidence level (1.0) with `InternetSearchPlugin.java`, our analysis revealed that this entity has been removed from the project due to version iteration. Despite its removal, if any legacy code still references `OpenSearchPlugin.java`, it would need to be addressed during synchronization efforts.\n\n4. **`OpenSearchDescription.java`**: This entity has been co-changed with `InternetSearchPlugin.java` once, resulting in a lower confidence level of 0.5. While not as strongly correlated as the first two entities, it still holds relevance due to its co-change history and should be reviewed for possible synchronization.\n\n5. **`InternetSearchAction.java`**: Similar to `OpenSearchDescription.java`, this entity has a low support count and confidence level of 0.5. Its inclusion in the change set is based on historical co-change patterns, suggesting that it might require attention during the modification of `InternetSearchPlugin.java`.\n\n6. **`UninstallOpenSearchPluginAction.java`**: With only one support and a confidence level of 0.5, this entity ranks last in the change set. Its co-change occurrence with `InternetSearchPlugin.java` is relatively weak; however, given the limited information, it is prudent to include it for review to ensure comprehensive coverage of all potentially impacted areas.\n\nIn summary, these entities are recommended for synchronized changes with `InternetSearchPlugin.java` based on their co-change history and coupling relationships, ensuring the overall stability and functionality of the software system.",

In order to help solve the CIA mission, you should first understand some necessary concepts\uff1a\n(1)entity: Entities represent source code files in CIA tasks, and all the CIA tasks under study are based on the Java language, so entities are files with the .java extension.\n(2)starting entity: The starting entity is also called salient entity, and the salient entity is the root change that causes the modification of the rest of entities in a change set, while the rest of entities are the dependency modification along with the salient one.\nYou will be presented with a starting entity and tools (functions) will be provided to access the more information of the origin system. Your task is to gradually explain which entity really need to be synchronized, based on the starting entity and the information obtained through the function-call. You have 7 chances to call the function to get more information."

Additionally, `WikiPanel` is referenced within `MainWindow`. Given this strong connection, `MainWindow` is likely to require synchronized modifications when `WikiPanel.java` is changed.\n\n2. **WebBrowserPanel**: Although there are no direct coupling dependencies between `WikiPanel.java` and `WebBrowserPanel`, it's included in the call graph of `WikiPanel.java`. Therefore, if `WikiPanel.java` interacts with web content, `WebBrowserPanel` might be affected by changes related to that interaction.\n\n3. **MDialog, MToolBar, MLogger, Net, FS, HTMLAutodiscovery, UI, Globals, Config, Tuple, Mods, WebBrowser, HTMLBuilder, MSwingWorker, MMessage, TK, MPanel, Item, MComboBox, MArrayList, MColor, MLinkButton, SwingWebBrowser, MTimer, MRenderer**: These entities are directly used by `WikiPanel.java`, as shown by the call graph. Any changes to `WikiPanel.java` could potentially impact these entities since they are directly referenced or called within `WikiPanel.java`.\n\nThe elements in the Change set are sorted in descending order of the likelihood of synchronized modifications based on the strength of their connections with `WikiPanel.java` through co-changes and direct usage. Entities such as `MainWindow` have a higher priority due to their historical co-change patterns and direct references. The remaining entities follow, ordered by their direct interactions with `WikiPanel.java` via method calls or variable references. Note that some entities like `WikiTab` and `Viewer` were excluded from the list because they have been removed from the project in recent iterations.",

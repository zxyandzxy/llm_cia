However, they share a strong conceptual similarity (probability of 0.762), indicating that changes in one might necessitate changes in the other.\n\n3. **MetaInfo.java**, **Tester.java**, **Flags.java**, **DT.java**, **Renderer.java**, **MouseGestures.java**, **TodoEditorDesigner.java**, **InsertImageAction.java**, **DurationFormatterBuilder.java**, **TestFlags.java**, **OPMLWriter.java**, **Connection.java**, **MObject.java**, **LinkEditor.java**, **ProxyModel.java**, **FeedViewer.java**, **ImageInfo.java**, **ConsoleIO.java**, **SnippetAction.java**: Each of these entities shares a co-change relationship with `HTMLBuilder.java`, having appeared once during past code modifications. The confidence level for these is 0.125, which is relatively low compared to the top two entities. These files are included based on historical co-change patterns but should be reviewed for any potential impact based on their functional relationships within the project.\n\nIt's important to note that while the first two entities have stronger evidence suggesting they should be modified alongside `HTMLBuilder.java`, the remaining entities should also be considered for synchronization if they interact closely with `HTMLBuilder.java` in terms of functionality or usage.

However, they share a strong conceptual similarity (probability of 0.762), indicating that changes in one might necessitate changes in the other.\n\n3. **MetaInfo.java**, **Tester.java**, **Flags.java**, **DT.java**, **Renderer.java**, **MouseGestures.java**, **TodoEditorDesigner.java**, **InsertImageAction.java**, **DurationFormatterBuilder.java**, **TestFlags.java**, **OPMLWriter.java**, **Connection.java**, **MObject.java**, **LinkEditor.java**, **ProxyModel.java**, **FeedViewer.java**, **ImageInfo.java**, **ConsoleIO.java**, **SnippetAction.java**: Each of these entities shares a co-change relationship with `HTMLBuilder.java`, having appeared once during past code modifications. The confidence level for these is 0.125, which is relatively low compared to the top two entities. These files are included based on historical co-change patterns but should be reviewed for any potential impact based on their functional relationships within the project.\n\nIt's important to note that while the first two entities have stronger evidence suggesting they should be modified alongside `HTMLBuilder.java`, the remaining entities should also be considered for synchronization if they interact closely with `HTMLBuilder.java` in terms of functionality or usage.

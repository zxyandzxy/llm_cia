In order to help solve the CIA mission, you should first understand some necessary concepts\uff1a\n(1)entity: Entities represent source code files in CIA tasks, and all the CIA tasks under study are based on the Java language, so entities are files with the .java extension.\n(2)starting entity: The starting entity is also called salient entity, and the salient entity is the root change that causes the modification of the rest of entities in a change set, while the rest of entities are the dependency modification along with the salient one.\nYou will be presented with a starting entity and tools (functions) will be provided to access the more information of the origin system. Your task is to gradually explain which entity really need to be synchronized, based on the starting entity and the information obtained through the function-call. You have 7 chances to call the function to get more information."

However, the conceptual coupling is also quite strong (approximately 0.82), indicating that these entities are likely related in terms of their functionality or purpose within the project. Therefore, it is advisable to consider `FeedComponent` for synchronized changes with `MTaskPanel.java`.\n\n3. **WebPanel** - Support: 2, Confidence: 0.222\n   While we did not explicitly check the conceptual coupling for `WebPanel`, it has been included in the co-change list with the same support and confidence as `FeedComponent`.

However, the conceptual coupling is also quite strong (approximately 0.82), indicating that these entities are likely related in terms of their functionality or purpose within the project. Therefore, it is advisable to consider `FeedComponent` for synchronized changes with `MTaskPanel.java`.\n\n3. **WebPanel** - Support: 2, Confidence: 0.222\n   While we did not explicitly check the conceptual coupling for `WebPanel`, it has been included in the co-change list with the same support and confidence as `FeedComponent`.

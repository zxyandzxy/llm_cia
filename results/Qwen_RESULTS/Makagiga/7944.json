Although there are no direct coupling dependencies or call relationships detected, there is a notable conceptual coupling with a semantic similarity probability of 0.720395.

Thus, it is highly probable that changes to `EditorNavigation.java` would necessitate synchronized modifications to `MainWindow.java`.\n\n- `FeedViewer.java`: Similarly, `FeedViewer.java` also shares a co-change relationship with `EditorNavigation.java`, supported by one instance in the change history with the same perfect confidence level of 1.0. The conceptual coupling between these two entities shows a semantic similarity probability of approximately 0.71324295.

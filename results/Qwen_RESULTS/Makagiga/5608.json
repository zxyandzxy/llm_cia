It may have related functionality that requires synchronization.\n\n3. `FontListPreloader.java`: Support - 1, Confidence - 0.2\n   Similar to `FontAction.java`, this entity has appeared alongside `MFontChooser.java` in previous changes. Given its support and confidence, it should be considered for potential synchronized modifications.\n\n4. `HistoryAction.java`: Support - 1, Confidence - 0.2\n   This entity also shares the same level of support and confidence as `FontAction.java` and `FontListPreloader.java`. It might require updates when `MFontChooser.java` is changed, although there is no direct evidence of coupling dependencies.\n\n5. `TextEditor.java`: Support - 1, Confidence - 0.2\n   With the same support and confidence levels, `TextEditor.java` is another entity that has been modified along with `MFontChooser.java` in the past and should be reviewed for necessary changes.\n\n6. `ItemRenderer.java`: Support - 1, Confidence - 0.2\n   The last in our list, `ItemRenderer.java` has the same support and confidence as the above entities. While it has less indication of requiring synchronization, it has still been involved in past co-changes with `MFontChooser.java`.\n\nIn conclusion, when modifying `MFontChooser.java`, you should prioritize reviewing and potentially updating `MFontButton.java` due to its high support, confidence, and conceptual similarity. The other entities listed should also be examined but are less likely to require changes compared to `MFontButton.java`. Direct call dependencies found through `get_call_graph` (e.g., `RequestSource.java`) should always be checked for synchronization regardless of their appearance in co-change history.

It may have related functionality that requires synchronization.\n\n3. `FontListPreloader.java`: Support - 1, Confidence - 0.2\n   Similar to `FontAction.java`, this entity has appeared alongside `MFontChooser.java` in previous changes. Given its support and confidence, it should be considered for potential synchronized modifications.\n\n4. `HistoryAction.java`: Support - 1, Confidence - 0.2\n   This entity also shares the same level of support and confidence as `FontAction.java` and `FontListPreloader.java`. It might require updates when `MFontChooser.java` is changed, although there is no direct evidence of coupling dependencies.\n\n5. `TextEditor.java`: Support - 1, Confidence - 0.2\n   With the same support and confidence levels, `TextEditor.java` is another entity that has been modified along with `MFontChooser.java` in the past and should be reviewed for necessary changes.\n\n6. `ItemRenderer.java`: Support - 1, Confidence - 0.2\n   The last in our list, `ItemRenderer.java` has the same support and confidence as the above entities. While it has less indication of requiring synchronization, it has still been involved in past co-changes with `MFontChooser.java`.\n\nIn conclusion, when modifying `MFontChooser.java`, you should prioritize reviewing and potentially updating `MFontButton.java` due to its high support, confidence, and conceptual similarity. The other entities listed should also be examined but are less likely to require changes compared to `MFontButton.java`. Direct call dependencies found through `get_call_graph` (e.g., `RequestSource.java`) should always be checked for synchronization regardless of their appearance in co-change history. However, these were not included in the final change set as per the instructions to base the decision on the results from `get_co_change_relationship`.",

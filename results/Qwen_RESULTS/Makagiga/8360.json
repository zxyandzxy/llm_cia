However, it was removed from the project due to version iteration. Despite this, its high co-change frequency suggests that any functionality previously handled by `PropertiesDialog` might still be relevant and should be reviewed for potential updates or replacements.\n\n2. **SearchFS**: Co-changed with `FSProperties.java` 2 times, with a confidence level of 0.5. It has also been removed from the project. Similar to `PropertiesDialog`, although it is no longer part of the current codebase, its history indicates that changes to `FSProperties.java` may have implications for related search functionalities.\n\n3. **FeedsFS**: This entity shares a co-change relationship with `FSProperties.java` 2 times, with a confidence level of 0.5. There are no coupling dependencies between `FeedsFS` and `FSProperties.java`. However, their conceptual coupling shows a semantic similarity probability of approximately 0.726, suggesting that they are conceptually related. Therefore, changes to `FSProperties.java` may require careful consideration of `FeedsFS` to ensure consistency across related functionalities.\n\n4. **CustomGeneralPanel, CustomAdvancedPanel, ImageEditorCore, TaskTable, Tester, PropertiesPanel**: These entities were each co-changed once with `FSProperties.java`, yielding a confidence level of 0.25. The lower confidence levels indicate less certainty about the necessity of synchronized changes. Nonetheless, these entities represent areas where past developers have made concurrent modifications with `FSProperties.java`, suggesting some degree of functional interdependence. Given the limited information available, these entities should be reviewed during significant changes to `FSProperties.java` to ensure that all dependent parts of the system remain coherent.\n\nIn conclusion, while `PropertiesDialog` and `SearchFS` are no longer present in the current version of the Makagiga project, their historical co-change patterns highlight the need to consider their replacements or equivalent functionalities when modifying `FSProperties.java`. On the other hand, `FeedsFS` stands out as an active entity that is conceptually similar to `FSProperties.java`, making it the primary candidate for synchronization. The remaining entities in the change set should be monitored but may not require immediate action unless there's a specific reason based on the nature of the changes being made.",

However, it was removed from the project due to version iteration. Despite this, its high co-change frequency suggests that any functionality previously handled by `PropertiesDialog` might still be relevant and should be reviewed for potential updates or replacements.\n\n2. **SearchFS**: Co-changed with `FSProperties.java` 2 times, with a confidence level of 0.5. It has also been removed from the project. Similar to `PropertiesDialog`, although it is no longer part of the current codebase, its history indicates that changes to `FSProperties.java` may have implications for related search functionalities.\n\n3. **FeedsFS**: This entity shares a co-change relationship with `FSProperties.java` 2 times, with a confidence level of 0.5. There are no coupling dependencies between `FeedsFS` and `FSProperties.java`. However, their conceptual coupling shows a semantic similarity probability of approximately 0.726, suggesting that they are conceptually related. Therefore, changes to `FSProperties.java` may require careful consideration of `FeedsFS` to ensure consistency across related functionalities.\n\n4. **CustomGeneralPanel, CustomAdvancedPanel, ImageEditorCore, TaskTable, Tester, PropertiesPanel**: These entities were each co-changed once with `FSProperties.java`, yielding a confidence level of 0.25. The lower confidence levels indicate less certainty about the necessity of synchronized changes. Nonetheless, these entities represent areas where past developers have made concurrent modifications with `FSProperties.java`, suggesting some degree of functional interdependence. Given the limited information available, these entities should be reviewed during significant changes to `FSProperties.java` to ensure that all dependent parts of the system remain coherent.\n\nIn conclusion, while `PropertiesDialog` and `SearchFS` are no longer present in the current version of the Makagiga project, their historical co-change patterns highlight the need to consider their replacements or equivalent functionalities when modifying `FSProperties.java`. On the other hand, `FeedsFS` stands out as an active entity that is conceptually similar to `FSProperties.java`, making it the primary candidate for synchronization. The remaining entities in the change set should be monitored but may not require immediate action unless there's a specific reason based on the nature of the changes being made.",

These could be due to shared features, user interface interactions, or perhaps changes in response to broader architectural updates within the project.\n\nGiven that we've exhausted our search for direct coupling dependencies, let's consider another approach.

This suggests that there is a notable conceptual relationship or semantic similarity between the two files, indicating they may serve related purposes within the project.\n\nWith this relatively high semantic similarity, it reinforces the idea that changes to `SessionManager.java` could have implications for `MainWindow.java`, even if there are no direct coupling dependencies between them. This might be due to their roles in managing and presenting session-related information to the user, which would naturally lead to intertwined changes when features or UI elements related to sessions are modified.\n\nSince we have used up our chances to call more functions, let's summarize what we've learned:\n\n1. Co-change analysis revealed multiple entities that were often changed alongside `SessionManager.java`, with `MainWindow.java` showing the highest confidence level.\n2. Call graph analysis showed that `SessionManager.java` directly references several entities, including `MSplashScreen.java`.\n3. No direct coupling dependencies were found between `SessionManager.java` and either `MainWindow.java` or `MSplashScreen.java`.\n4. Semantic analysis indicated a strong conceptual relationship between `SessionManager.java` and `MainWindow.java`.\n\nBased on these findings, it seems prudent to synchronize changes with `MainWindow.java` when modifying `SessionManager.java` because of their shared functionality and high semantic similarity, even though they do not have direct code interdependencies. Additionally, while `MSplashScreen.java` is referenced by `SessionManager.java`, the lack of both co-change evidence and coupling dependencies makes it less critical for synchronization compared to `MainWindow.java`.

Additionally, the semantic similarity probability of approximately 0.695 suggests a strong conceptual relationship, making it highly likely that changes to `SessionManager.java` will necessitate changes to `MainWindow.java`.\n\n2. **MSplashScreen**: This entity appears both in the call graph and the co-change results with a support count of 1 and a confidence of 0.25. While there are no coupling dependencies, its presence in the call graph indicates that `SessionManager.java` interacts with it directly, suggesting potential need for synchronization.\n\n3. **Tabs**: Similar to `MSplashScreen`, `Tabs` has a low support count and confidence (both 1 and 0.25 respectively). It's included in the change set due to its appearance in the co-change list.\n\n4. **GetTextBuilder**, **Validator**, **TreeSettingsButton**, **AdvancedSettingsPage**, **RestoreSessionMenu**, **EditSessionsMenu**, **EditorQuickFind**, **Armor**, **Permission**, **ListWriter**, **ListReader**, **NavigationUtils**, **ListSupport**: These entities have appeared in the co-change results with a support count of 1 and a confidence of 0.25. They are included in the change set based on their co-change history with `SessionManager.java`. However, since there is no additional evidence of direct interaction or conceptual coupling, they are ranked lower in the change set compared to `MainWindow` and `MSplashScreen`.\n\nIn conclusion, when changes are made to `SessionManager.java`, special attention should be given to synchronizing changes with `MainWindow` due to its high confidence level of co-changes and strong conceptual relationship. `MSplashScreen` should also be considered due to its direct interaction with `SessionManager.java`. The remaining entities in the change set should be reviewed within the context of the specific changes being made to determine if they require corresponding updates.",

This might be due to their roles in managing and presenting session-related information to the user, which would naturally lead to intertwined changes when features or UI elements related to sessions are modified.\n\nSince we have used up our chances to call more functions, let's summarize what we've learned:\n\n1. Co-change analysis revealed multiple entities that were often changed alongside `SessionManager.java`, with `MainWindow.java` showing the highest confidence level.\n2. Call graph analysis showed that `SessionManager.java` directly references several entities, including `MSplashScreen.java`.\n3. No direct coupling dependencies were found between `SessionManager.java` and either `MainWindow.java` or `MSplashScreen.java`.\n4. Semantic analysis indicated a strong conceptual relationship between `SessionManager.java` and `MainWindow.java`.\n\nBased on these findings, it seems prudent to synchronize changes with `MainWindow.java` when modifying `SessionManager.java` because of their shared functionality and high semantic similarity, even though they do not have direct code interdependencies. Additionally, while `MSplashScreen.java` is referenced by `SessionManager.java`, the lack of both co-change evidence and coupling dependencies makes it less critical for synchronization compared to `MainWindow.java`.

Additionally, the semantic similarity probability of approximately 0.695 suggests a strong conceptual relationship, making it highly likely that changes to `SessionManager.java` will necessitate changes to `MainWindow.java`.\n\n2. **MSplashScreen**: This entity appears both in the call graph and the co-change results with a support count of 1 and a confidence of 0.25. While there are no coupling dependencies, its presence in the call graph indicates that `SessionManager.java` interacts with it directly, suggesting potential need for synchronization.\n\n3. **Tabs**: Similar to `MSplashScreen`, `Tabs` has a low support count and confidence (both 1 and 0.25 respectively). It's included in the change set due to its appearance in the co-change list.\n\n4. **GetTextBuilder**, **Validator**, **TreeSettingsButton**, **AdvancedSettingsPage**, **RestoreSessionMenu**, **EditSessionsMenu**, **EditorQuickFind**, **Armor**, **Permission**, **ListWriter**, **ListReader**, **NavigationUtils**, **ListSupport**: These entities have appeared in the co-change results with a support count of 1 and a confidence of 0.25. They are included in the change set based on their co-change history with `SessionManager.java`. However, since there is no additional evidence of direct interaction or conceptual coupling, they are ranked lower in the change set compared to `MainWindow` and `MSplashScreen`.\n\nIn conclusion, when changes are made to `SessionManager.java`, special attention should be given to synchronizing changes with `MainWindow` due to its high confidence level of co-changes and strong conceptual relationship. `MSplashScreen` should also be considered due to its direct interaction with `SessionManager.java`. The remaining entities in the change set should be reviewed within the context of the specific changes being made to determine if they require corresponding updates.",

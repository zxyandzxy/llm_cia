In order to help solve the CIA mission, you should first understand some necessary concepts\uff1a\n(1)entity: Entities represent source code files in CIA tasks, and all the CIA tasks under study are based on the Java language, so entities are files with the .java extension.\n(2)starting entity: The starting entity is also called salient entity, and the salient entity is the root change that causes the modification of the rest of entities in a change set, while the rest of entities are the dependency modification along with the salient one.\nYou will be presented with a starting entity and tools (functions) will be provided to access the more information of the origin system. Your task is to gradually explain which entity really need to be synchronized, based on the starting entity and the information obtained through the function-call. You have 7 chances to call the function to get more information."

This suggests that they are likely part of the same feature or user workflow, which implies a high chance that any changes in `Kiosk.java` may require corresponding adjustments in `MainWindow.java`.\n\n2. **ExtraKiosk.java**: Similar to `MainWindow.java`, there are no direct coupling dependencies between `Kiosk.java` and `ExtraKiosk.java`. However, `ExtraKiosk.java` was changed four times along with `Kiosk.java`, resulting in a confidence score of 0.5. Given its name, it's reasonable to assume that `ExtraKiosk.java` provides additional functionality related to `Kiosk.java`, thus necessitating synchronized changes.\n\n3. **MURLButton.java**: With three co-changes recorded and a confidence of 0.375, `MURLButton.java` appears to be frequently modified alongside `Kiosk.java`. Despite the lack of direct method calls or variable references from `Kiosk.java` to `MURLButton.java`, these two files seem to share some functional relationship that requires them to be updated together.\n\n4. **MText.java**: Co-changing twice with `Kiosk.java` gives `MText.java` a confidence score of 0.25. While there is no evidence of code coupling, `MText.java` could be another component that interacts with or relies on configurations managed by `Kiosk.java`.\n\n5. **ChartDialog.java**: Like `MText.java`, `ChartDialog.java` also shares two co-changes with `Kiosk.java`, leading to a confidence score of 0.25. It might be part of the same feature or module as `Kiosk.java`, requiring synchronized modifications when there are updates to configuration settings.\n\n6. **TaskTable.java**: Having been co-changed twice with `Kiosk.java` and sharing a confidence score of 0.25, `TaskTable.java` is included in the change set due to potential shared functionality or involvement in the same feature area within the application.\n\nIn conclusion, while explicit technical dependencies were not found, the entities listed above have shown historical patterns of being changed together with `Kiosk.java`. Therefore, when modifying `Kiosk.java`, it is advisable to consider checking and possibly updating these entities to maintain consistency across the application.",

This suggests that they are likely part of the same feature or user workflow, which implies a high chance that any changes in `Kiosk.java` may require corresponding adjustments in `MainWindow.java`.\n\n2. **ExtraKiosk.java**: Similar to `MainWindow.java`, there are no direct coupling dependencies between `Kiosk.java` and `ExtraKiosk.java`. However, `ExtraKiosk.java` was changed four times along with `Kiosk.java`, resulting in a confidence score of 0.5. Given its name, it's reasonable to assume that `ExtraKiosk.java` provides additional functionality related to `Kiosk.java`, thus necessitating synchronized changes.\n\n3. **MURLButton.java**: With three co-changes recorded and a confidence of 0.375, `MURLButton.java` appears to be frequently modified alongside `Kiosk.java`. Despite the lack of direct method calls or variable references from `Kiosk.java` to `MURLButton.java`, these two files seem to share some functional relationship that requires them to be updated together.\n\n4. **MText.java**: Co-changing twice with `Kiosk.java` gives `MText.java` a confidence score of 0.25. While there is no evidence of code coupling, `MText.java` could be another component that interacts with or relies on configurations managed by `Kiosk.java`.\n\n5. **ChartDialog.java**: Like `MText.java`, `ChartDialog.java` also shares two co-changes with `Kiosk.java`, leading to a confidence score of 0.25. It might be part of the same feature or module as `Kiosk.java`, requiring synchronized modifications when there are updates to configuration settings.\n\n6. **TaskTable.java**: Having been co-changed twice with `Kiosk.java` and sharing a confidence score of 0.25, `TaskTable.java` is included in the change set due to potential shared functionality or involvement in the same feature area within the application.\n\nIn conclusion, while explicit technical dependencies were not found, the entities listed above have shown historical patterns of being changed together with `Kiosk.java`. Therefore, when modifying `Kiosk.java`, it is advisable to consider checking and possibly updating these entities to maintain consistency across the application.",

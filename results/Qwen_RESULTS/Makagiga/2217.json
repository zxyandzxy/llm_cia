However, due to their co-change history, they might still require attention if significant changes are made to `MCellTip.java`.\n\nThe elements in the Change set are sorted in descending order of the likelihood of synchronized modifications based on historical co-change patterns and conceptual coupling. The first two files, `MTable` and `Tree`, are most likely to require changes in conjunction with `MCellTip.java` due to their strong semantic relationships.

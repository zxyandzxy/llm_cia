Therefore, `TextPrintInfo.java` should be considered for synchronization when making changes to `PrintDialog.java`.\n\nGiven that we've used up several of our function calls, let's summarize the findings:\n\n- `PrintAction.java` was strongly co-changed with `PrintDialog.java`, but it has been removed from the project.\n- `TextPrintInfo.java` has a high conceptual similarity with `PrintDialog.java`, indicating they might need to be synchronized despite the lack of direct coupling or call graph connections.\n- Other entities such as `ImagePrintInfo.java`, `AbstractPrintInfo.java`, and `ChartDialog.java` also show some degree of co-change history but were not explored further due to limited function calls.\n\nBased on this analysis, `TextPrintInfo.java` is recommended to be included in the synchronization process along with `PrintDialog.java`.

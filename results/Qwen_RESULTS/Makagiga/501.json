Moreover, it directly calls methods from `TextUtils.java` as shown by the call graph analysis. It also has a high semantic similarity score, indicating shared functionality or domain overlap. Therefore, it is highly likely that changes in `TextUtils.java` will require corresponding changes in `NotepadEditor`.\n\n2. **FeedViewer, EditorSearch, TaskTable**: These entities have been changed alongside `TextUtils.java` once in the past, showing a support count of 1 and a confidence level of 0.25. While they do not show direct coupling dependencies or calls to `TextUtils.java`, their co-change relationship suggests some indirect dependency or common context that makes them candidates for synchronization.\n\n3. **MMenu, TodoEditor, EditorQuickFind, TextEditor, StaticHighlighterHandler, AbstractTextEditor, WebBrowserEditor, NotepadEditorDesigner, NonePreview, StaticHandler, Core, CodePreviewProvider**: Each of these entities shares the same support count (1) and confidence level (0.25) as the previous group but without any additional evidence of direct interaction with `TextUtils.java`. Their inclusion in the change set is based primarily on historical co-change patterns which suggest potential indirect relationships or contextual similarities.\n\nIt's important to note that while the first entity, `NotepadEditor`, shows clear signs of requiring synchronized changes due to its direct usage of `TextUtils.java`, the other entities are more speculative and should be reviewed carefully to determine if actual changes are necessary. The decision to modify these files should take into account the specific nature of the changes being made to `TextUtils.java` and whether those changes could affect the functionalities provided by these other entities.",

Moreover, it directly calls methods from `TextUtils.java` as shown by the call graph analysis. It also has a high semantic similarity score, indicating shared functionality or domain overlap. Therefore, it is highly likely that changes in `TextUtils.java` will require corresponding changes in `NotepadEditor`.\n\n2. **FeedViewer, EditorSearch, TaskTable**: These entities have been changed alongside `TextUtils.java` once in the past, showing a support count of 1 and a confidence level of 0.25. While they do not show direct coupling dependencies or calls to `TextUtils.java`, their co-change relationship suggests some indirect dependency or common context that makes them candidates for synchronization.\n\n3. **MMenu, TodoEditor, EditorQuickFind, TextEditor, StaticHighlighterHandler, AbstractTextEditor, WebBrowserEditor, NotepadEditorDesigner, NonePreview, StaticHandler, Core, CodePreviewProvider**: Each of these entities shares the same support count (1) and confidence level (0.25) as the previous group but without any additional evidence of direct interaction with `TextUtils.java`. Their inclusion in the change set is based primarily on historical co-change patterns which suggest potential indirect relationships or contextual similarities.\n\nIt's important to note that while the first entity, `NotepadEditor`, shows clear signs of requiring synchronized changes due to its direct usage of `TextUtils.java`, the other entities are more speculative and should be reviewed carefully to determine if actual changes are necessary. The decision to modify these files should take into account the specific nature of the changes being made to `TextUtils.java` and whether those changes could affect the functionalities provided by these other entities.",

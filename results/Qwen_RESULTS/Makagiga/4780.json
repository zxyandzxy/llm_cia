Moreover, there is a high conceptual coupling with a semantic similarity probability of approximately 0.87. This suggests that despite the lack of direct coupling dependencies, these two entities are closely related functionally, making it necessary to synchronize changes to ensure consistency and prevent potential issues.\n\n2. **WebService**: Similarly, `WebService` shares a co-change relationship with `WebPanel.java`, with a support count of 1 and a confidence of 1.0. Although no direct coupling dependencies were found, the conceptual coupling between `WebPanel.java` and `WebService` is significant, with a semantic similarity probability of around 0.83. This implies that they share relevant functionality or purpose within the project, necessitating synchronized modifications to maintain their aligned purposes.\n\nThe elements in the Change set are sorted in descending order of the likelihood of synchronized modifications based on the confidence level of the co-change relationships and the strength of conceptual coupling.

Moreover, there is a high conceptual coupling with a semantic similarity probability of approximately 0.87. This suggests that despite the lack of direct coupling dependencies, these two entities are closely related functionally, making it necessary to synchronize changes to ensure consistency and prevent potential issues.\n\n2. **WebService**: Similarly, `WebService` shares a co-change relationship with `WebPanel.java`, with a support count of 1 and a confidence of 1.0. Although no direct coupling dependencies were found, the conceptual coupling between `WebPanel.java` and `WebService` is significant, with a semantic similarity probability of around 0.83. This implies that they share relevant functionality or purpose within the project, necessitating synchronized modifications to maintain their aligned purposes.\n\nThe elements in the Change set are sorted in descending order of the likelihood of synchronized modifications based on the confidence level of the co-change relationships and the strength of conceptual coupling.

Any changes to the parent class `Designer.java` will likely require corresponding changes in its subclass `TextEditorDesigner.java`. With a support count of 3 and confidence of 0.75, this entity has a high probability of being modified alongside `Designer.java`.\n\n2. **ImageEditorDesigner.java**: Similar to `TextEditorDesigner.java`, this entity also inherits from `Designer.java`. The strong inheritance relationship means that modifications to `Designer.java` could affect this entity as well. It shares the same support count and confidence level with `TextEditorDesigner.java`, making it equally important for synchronization.\n\n3. **MainWindow.java**: Although not directly inheriting from or used by `Designer.java`, `MainWindow.java` has a conceptual coupling with a semantic similarity probability of 0.729. This suggests that changes to `Designer.java` might have implications for `MainWindow.java`, which appeared in co-change history with a support count of 2 and a confidence of 0.5.\n\n4. **PropertyPanel.java**: This entity appears in the call graph of `Designer.java`, meaning it is directly called or used by `Designer.java`. Changes to `Designer.java` could necessitate updates to how `PropertyPanel.java` interacts with it, even though it did not show up in the co-change analysis with high support or confidence.\n\n5. **Sidebar.java**: Like `PropertyPanel.java`, `Sidebar.java` is included in the call graph of `Designer.java`, indicating direct interaction. Though it was mentioned in the co-change list with a low support count and confidence, its direct usage within `Designer.java` makes it relevant for potential synchronization.\n\nIn conclusion, entities are listed based on the strength of their relationships (inheritance and conceptual coupling) and their direct interactions (call graph). `TextEditorDesigner.java` and `ImageEditorDesigner.java` should be prioritized due to their inheritance relationship with `Designer.java`, followed by `MainWindow.java` due to its conceptual coupling. Finally, `PropertyPanel.java` and `Sidebar.java` are included because of their direct interaction with `Designer.java`.",

Any changes to the parent class `Designer.java` will likely require corresponding changes in its subclass `TextEditorDesigner.java`. With a support count of 3 and confidence of 0.75, this entity has a high probability of being modified alongside `Designer.java`.\n\n2. **ImageEditorDesigner.java**: Similar to `TextEditorDesigner.java`, this entity also inherits from `Designer.java`. The strong inheritance relationship means that modifications to `Designer.java` could affect this entity as well. It shares the same support count and confidence level with `TextEditorDesigner.java`, making it equally important for synchronization.\n\n3. **MainWindow.java**: Although not directly inheriting from or used by `Designer.java`, `MainWindow.java` has a conceptual coupling with a semantic similarity probability of 0.729. This suggests that changes to `Designer.java` might have implications for `MainWindow.java`, which appeared in co-change history with a support count of 2 and a confidence of 0.5.\n\n4. **PropertyPanel.java**: This entity appears in the call graph of `Designer.java`, meaning it is directly called or used by `Designer.java`. Changes to `Designer.java` could necessitate updates to how `PropertyPanel.java` interacts with it, even though it did not show up in the co-change analysis with high support or confidence.\n\n5. **Sidebar.java**: Like `PropertyPanel.java`, `Sidebar.java` is included in the call graph of `Designer.java`, indicating direct interaction. Though it was mentioned in the co-change list with a low support count and confidence, its direct usage within `Designer.java` makes it relevant for potential synchronization.\n\nIn conclusion, entities are listed based on the strength of their relationships (inheritance and conceptual coupling) and their direct interactions (call graph). `TextEditorDesigner.java` and `ImageEditorDesigner.java` should be prioritized due to their inheritance relationship with `Designer.java`, followed by `MainWindow.java` due to its conceptual coupling. Finally, `PropertyPanel.java` and `Sidebar.java` are included because of their direct interaction with `Designer.java`.",

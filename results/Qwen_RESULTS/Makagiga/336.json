This suggests that these two entities are conceptually related, likely because they deal with similar concepts or functionalities within the project.\n\nBased on this information, it seems prudent to consider `CalendarWidget.java` as a candidate for synchronization when changes are made to `MDateSpinner.java`.\n\nGiven that we have one strong candidate from the conceptual coupling (`CalendarWidget.java`) and considering the co-change relationships, I will now suggest the following:\n\n1. Synchronize `CalendarWidget.java` due to its high conceptual coupling with `MDateSpinner.java`.\n2. Although other files had low confidence in co-change relationship, since `MDateSpinnerBeanInfo.java` no longer exists, and there were no direct call graph dependencies found, we might not need to worry about synchronizing the others unless further evidence suggests otherwise.\n\nIf you agree with this analysis, we can conclude that `CalendarWidget.java` should be synchronized with changes to `MDateSpinner.java`.

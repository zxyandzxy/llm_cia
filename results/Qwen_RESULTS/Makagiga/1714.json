In order to help solve the CIA mission, you should first understand some necessary concepts\uff1a\n(1)entity: Entities represent source code files in CIA tasks, and all the CIA tasks under study are based on the Java language, so entities are files with the .java extension.\n(2)starting entity: The starting entity is also called salient entity, and the salient entity is the root change that causes the modification of the rest of entities in a change set, while the rest of entities are the dependency modification along with the salient one.\nYou will be presented with a starting entity and tools (functions) will be provided to access the more information of the origin system. Your task is to gradually explain which entity really need to be synchronized, based on the starting entity and the information obtained through the function-call. You have 7 chances to call the function to get more information."

It suggests that changes in `TodoEditorCore.java` often coincide with changes in `TaskManager`, possibly due to shared functionality or architectural updates.\n\n2. **Task** (Supports: 3, Confidence: 0.1667)\n   - Similar to `TaskManager`, `Task` shares a significant co-change history with `TodoEditorCore.java`. The absence of direct coupling dependencies does not negate its importance; it implies a possible higher-level dependency or business logic alignment requiring concurrent changes.\n\n3. **TodoEditor** (Supports: 3, Confidence: 0.1667)\n   - This entity also shows a strong co-change relationship with `TodoEditorCore.java`. As part of the same feature set or module, it likely contains complementary functionalities that need to be updated together to maintain system integrity.\n\n4. **Tracker** (Supports: 2, Confidence: 0.1111, Conceptual Coupling: 0.836)\n   - Besides being called directly by `TodoEditorCore.java`, `Tracker` exhibits a strong conceptual similarity with it. This indicates a close functional relationship and highlights the necessity of synchronizing changes to ensure consistent behavior and functionality.\n\n5. **TaskList** (Called by TodoEditorCore.java)\n   - `TaskList` is directly used within `TodoEditorCore.java`, indicating an immediate code dependency. Changes in `TodoEditorCore.java` might affect how `TaskList` is utilized, making it essential to review and potentially update `TaskList` as well.\n\n6. **TaskInfo** (Called by TodoEditorCore.java)\n   - Like `TaskList`, `TaskInfo` is another entity directly referenced by `TodoEditorCore.java`. Given its usage within `TodoEditorCore.java`, any modifications may require corresponding adjustments in `TaskInfo` to preserve the intended functionality.\n\nIn conclusion, while some entities are chosen based on their co-change patterns, others like `Tracker` are included due to both direct usage and strong conceptual relationships. The entities listed in the change set should be reviewed and modified accordingly to maintain the consistency and integrity of the `Makagiga` project's functionality.",

It suggests that changes in `TodoEditorCore.java` often coincide with changes in `TaskManager`, possibly due to shared functionality or architectural updates.\n\n2. **Task** (Supports: 3, Confidence: 0.1667)\n   - Similar to `TaskManager`, `Task` shares a significant co-change history with `TodoEditorCore.java`. The absence of direct coupling dependencies does not negate its importance; it implies a possible higher-level dependency or business logic alignment requiring concurrent changes.\n\n3. **TodoEditor** (Supports: 3, Confidence: 0.1667)\n   - This entity also shows a strong co-change relationship with `TodoEditorCore.java`. As part of the same feature set or module, it likely contains complementary functionalities that need to be updated together to maintain system integrity.\n\n4. **Tracker** (Supports: 2, Confidence: 0.1111, Conceptual Coupling: 0.836)\n   - Besides being called directly by `TodoEditorCore.java`, `Tracker` exhibits a strong conceptual similarity with it. This indicates a close functional relationship and highlights the necessity of synchronizing changes to ensure consistent behavior and functionality.\n\n5. **TaskList** (Called by TodoEditorCore.java)\n   - `TaskList` is directly used within `TodoEditorCore.java`, indicating an immediate code dependency. Changes in `TodoEditorCore.java` might affect how `TaskList` is utilized, making it essential to review and potentially update `TaskList` as well.\n\n6. **TaskInfo** (Called by TodoEditorCore.java)\n   - Like `TaskList`, `TaskInfo` is another entity directly referenced by `TodoEditorCore.java`. Given its usage within `TodoEditorCore.java`, any modifications may require corresponding adjustments in `TaskInfo` to preserve the intended functionality.\n\nIn conclusion, while some entities are chosen based on their co-change patterns, others like `Tracker` are included due to both direct usage and strong conceptual relationships. The entities listed in the change set should be reviewed and modified accordingly to maintain the consistency and integrity of the `Makagiga` project's functionality.",

In order to help solve the CIA mission, you should first understand some necessary concepts\uff1a\n(1)entity: Entities represent source code files in CIA tasks, and all the CIA tasks under study are based on the Java language, so entities are files with the .java extension.\n(2)starting entity: The starting entity is also called salient entity, and the salient entity is the root change that causes the modification of the rest of entities in a change set, while the rest of entities are the dependency modification along with the salient one.\nYou will be presented with a starting entity and tools (functions) will be provided to access the more information of the origin system. Your task is to gradually explain which entity really need to be synchronized, based on the starting entity and the information obtained through the function-call. You have 7 chances to call the function to get more information."

The absence of coupling dependencies suggests that changes may be due to being related components in the system rather than explicit code interdependencies.\n- `SearchBar.java`: Similar to `MTextFieldBeanInfo.java`, it was changed 2 times out of 7 modifications of `MTextField.java` with a confidence level of 0.286. Co-changes likely occur because they belong to the same functional area or module.\n- `AutoCompletion.java`: This entity directly uses `MTextField.java`. Changes in `MTextField` could affect the behavior of `AutoCompletion`, and thus, this entity should be reviewed for necessary updates even though there are no additional coupling dependencies detected.\n- `StyleSupport.java`: Like `AutoCompletion.java`, it also directly uses `MTextField.java`.

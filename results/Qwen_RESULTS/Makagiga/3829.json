In order to help solve the CIA mission, you should first understand some necessary concepts\uff1a\n(1)entity: Entities represent source code files in CIA tasks, and all the CIA tasks under study are based on the Java language, so entities are files with the .java extension.\n(2)starting entity: The starting entity is also called salient entity, and the salient entity is the root change that causes the modification of the rest of entities in a change set, while the rest of entities are the dependency modification along with the salient one.\nYou will be presented with a starting entity and tools (functions) will be provided to access the more information of the origin system. Your task is to gradually explain which entity really need to be synchronized, based on the starting entity and the information obtained through the function-call. You have 7 chances to call the function to get more information."

Main.java: With 18 supports and a confidence level of 0.286, this entity has the highest likelihood of requiring synchronized changes with `MApplication.java`. Both files have high conceptual coupling (semantic similarity probability of 0.829), indicating that they share significant functionality or purpose within the application.\n\n2. MainWindow.java: This entity has 10 supports and a confidence level of 0.159. It also shows a relatively high conceptual coupling with `MApplication.java` (semantic similarity probability of 0.723). Changes to the core structure or UI of the application will likely affect both files.\n\n3. Args.java: Having 8 supports and a confidence of 0.127, this file is often changed alongside `MApplication.java`, possibly due to command-line argument handling or initialization procedures.\n\n4. MFrame.java: With 5 supports and a confidence level of 0.079, it indicates that there might be shared responsibilities related to the main window frame or general UI setup between these two entities.\n\n5. Console.java: Also having 5 supports and a confidence of 0.079, it suggests that console-related functionalities could be intertwined with the application's operations managed by `MApplication.java`.\n\n6. SDK.java: With 3 supports and a confidence level of 0.048, SDK may relate to software development kit components that are used in conjunction with `MApplication.java`.\n\n7. StaticHandler.java: Similarly, with 3 supports and a confidence of 0.048, StaticHandler could involve static resource management or utility functions that interact with `MApplication.java`.\n\n8. PluginSettings.java: Given 3 supports and a confidence of 0.048, this file likely contains settings for plugins that are configured or utilized through `MApplication.java`.\n\n9. MFileChooser.java: With 2 supports and a confidence of 0.032, it involves file choosing dialogs which could be integrated into the application's workflow managed by `MApplication.java`.\n\n10. AboutAction.java: Having 4 supports and a confidence of 0.063, it signifies actions related to displaying information about the application, typically invoked from the main application class.\n\n11. MAbout.java: Similar to AboutAction.java, it has 4 supports and a confidence of 0.063, potentially involving the presentation of an \"about\" dialog or similar informational display.\n\n12. Help.java: Also with 4 supports and a confidence of 0.063, Help is likely related to providing help content or documentation, which could be accessed via the main application interface.\n\n13. PluginManager.java: Having 4 supports and a confidence of 0.063, it deals with managing plugins, which is a critical part of the application's extensibility framework.\n\n14. PluginDownloader.java: With 3 supports and a confidence of 0.048, this entity manages the downloading of plugins, an operation closely linked to plugin management and application updates.\n\n15. SessionManager.java: With 2 supports and a confidence of 0.032, it suggests session handling that could be initiated or influenced by the main application logic.\n\n16. SummaryPanel.java: Lastly, with 1 support and a confidence of 0.016, it represents a lower but still present correlation, potentially involved in summarizing data or presenting a summary view within the application.\n\nThe change set provided above reflects the entities that should be considered for synchronized changes when modifying `MApplication.java`, ordered by their likelihood of needing concurrent modifications as determined by historical co-change patterns and conceptual coupling.",

Changes to the core structure or UI of the application will likely affect both files.\n\n3. Args.java: Having 8 supports and a confidence of 0.127, this file is often changed alongside `MApplication.java`, possibly due to command-line argument handling or initialization procedures.\n\n4.

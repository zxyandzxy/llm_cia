In order to help solve the CIA mission, you should first understand some necessary concepts\uff1a\n(1)entity: Entities represent source code files in CIA tasks, and all the CIA tasks under study are based on the Java language, so entities are files with the .java extension.\n(2)starting entity: The starting entity is also called salient entity, and the salient entity is the root change that causes the modification of the rest of entities in a change set, while the rest of entities are the dependency modification along with the salient one.\nYou will be presented with a starting entity and tools (functions) will be provided to access the more information of the origin system. Your task is to gradually explain which entity really need to be synchronized, based on the starting entity and the information obtained through the function-call.

Changes in the parent class (`AbstractFileCache`) often require corresponding changes in the child class (`Archive`) to maintain compatibility and functionality.\n- **FileCache**: Also needs synchronization because it extends `AbstractFileCache`. Similar to `Archive`, any modifications in the parent class are likely to affect this subclass as well.\n- **TestAbstractFileCache**: Likely a test class for `AbstractFileCache`, and although we didn't get an accurate coupling dependency result, changes to the main class typically necessitate updates to its tests to ensure they still pass and adequately cover the new or modified functionality.\n- **ChartUtils**: There are no coupling dependencies between `AbstractFileCache.java` and `ChartUtils`. However, based on the co-change analysis, there is some historical evidence that they were changed together once. The lack of direct coupling suggests that this co-change might have been coincidental rather than necessary.

The lack of direct coupling suggests that this co-change might have been coincidental rather than necessary.

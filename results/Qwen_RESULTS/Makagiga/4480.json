In order to help solve the CIA mission, you should first understand some necessary concepts\uff1a\n(1)entity: Entities represent source code files in CIA tasks, and all the CIA tasks under study are based on the Java language, so entities are files with the .java extension.\n(2)starting entity: The starting entity is also called salient entity, and the salient entity is the root change that causes the modification of the rest of entities in a change set, while the rest of entities are the dependency modification along with the salient one.\nYou will be presented with a starting entity and tools (functions) will be provided to access the more information of the origin system. Your task is to gradually explain which entity really need to be synchronized, based on the starting entity and the information obtained through the function-call. You have 7 chances to call the function to get more information."

Furthermore, the conceptual coupling between these two entities shows a high semantic similarity probability of approximately 0.868. This suggests that changes to `MetaInfoComparator.java` are highly likely to require corresponding changes in `SortComparator`.\n\n2. **FSHelper**: Similar to `SortComparator`, `FSHelper` also exhibits a strong co-change relationship with `MetaInfoComparator.java` (Supports: 1, Confidence: 1.0) and has a significant semantic similarity probability of around 0.826. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that any changes made to `MetaInfoComparator.java` should be accompanied by changes to `FSHelper`.\n\n3. **ByPathFilesFirst**: Although this entity has shown a co-change relationship with `MetaInfoComparator.java`, it has been removed from the project due to version iteration. As such, it no longer exists in the current version of the project and does not need to be considered for synchronization. Its inclusion here is purely informational based on historical data.\n\n4. **ByRating**: Like `ByPathFilesFirst`, `ByRating` has also been removed from the project and is not present in the current version. Despite its previous co-change relationship with `MetaInfoComparator.java`, it is not relevant for synchronization in the present context.\n\nIn summary, the elements in the Change set are:\n- **SortComparator** (Most likely to require synchronized changes)\n- **FSHelper** (Second most likely to require synchronized changes)\n- **ByPathFilesFirst** (Historically relevant but no longer part of the project)\n- **ByRating** (Also historically relevant but no longer part of the project)\n\nOnly `SortComparator` and `FSHelper` should be considered for actual synchronization with `MetaInfoComparator.java`.

Furthermore, the conceptual coupling between these two entities shows a high semantic similarity probability of approximately 0.868.

Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that any changes made to `MetaInfoComparator.java` should be accompanied by changes to `FSHelper`.\n\n3. **ByPathFilesFirst**: Although this entity has shown a co-change relationship with `MetaInfoComparator.java`, it has been removed from the project due to version iteration.

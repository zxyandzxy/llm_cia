In order to help solve the CIA mission, you should first understand some necessary concepts\uff1a\n(1)entity: Entities represent source code files in CIA tasks, and all the CIA tasks under study are based on the Java language, so entities are files with the .java extension.\n(2)starting entity: The starting entity is also called salient entity, and the salient entity is the root change that causes the modification of the rest of entities in a change set, while the rest of entities are the dependency modification along with the salient one.\nYou will be presented with a starting entity and tools (functions) will be provided to access the more information of the origin system. Your task is to gradually explain which entity really need to be synchronized, based on the starting entity and the information obtained through the function-call. You have 7 chances to call the function to get more information."

It's likely that changes in core functionality may require corresponding updates in the plugin.\n\n2. **SelectionTool.java**: With a support count of 5 and confidence of 0.185, this entity appears in both the co-change list and the call graph. Furthermore, it has a high conceptual coupling score (0.845), which implies a strong semantic relationship with `ImageEditorCore.java`.\n\n3. **ToolManager.java**: It has appeared multiple times in the co-change relationship results and is used by `ImageEditorCore.java`. The usage pattern suggests that any modification in the tool management logic might affect how tools are handled within the editor.\n\n4. **ImageEditorDesigner.java**: This entity also shows up in the co-change relationship with a support count of 4 and a confidence of 0.148. It is likely related to the design aspect of image editing tools, which could be affected by changes in core functionalities.\n\n5. **BrushTool.java**: With a support count of 3 and confidence of 0.111, it indicates moderate historical co-changes with `ImageEditorCore.java`. Its presence in the call graph implies direct interaction.\n\n6. **FiltersAction.java**: Appears in the co-change list with a support count of 3 and confidence of 0.111. Changes in filtering capabilities might need adjustments in core components as well.\n\n7. **RectangleTool.java**: Shows up in the co-change relationship with a confidence of 0.037 and is called by `ImageEditorCore.java`.\n\n8. **EraserTool.java**: Listed in the co-change relationship with a confidence of 0.037 and present in the call graph, implying its use within the editor.\n\n9. **AbstractTool.java**: Present in the co-change relationship with a support count of 2 and confidence of 0.074, and it is part of the call graph, indicating it serves as a base class for other tools.\n\n10. **DefaultPreview.java**: Listed in the co-change relationship with a support count of 1 and confidence of 0.037, suggesting it might be involved in previewing images or changes.\n\n11. **IconTheme.java**, **MIconChooser.java**, **Tree.java**, **MStatusBar.java**, **MirrorDialog.java**, **RotateAction.java**, **ResizeAction.java**, **CropAction.java**, **AnnotationBar.java**, **TextEditor.java**: These entities have lower support counts and confidences but still appear in the co-change relationship.

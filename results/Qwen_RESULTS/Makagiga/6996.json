Your task is to gradually explain which entity really need to be synchronized, based on the starting entity and the information obtained through the function-call.

We identified several entities that have been frequently co-changed with `SummaryData.java`, such as `SummaryPanel.java`, `Reminder.java`, `SummaryTree.java`, `Action.java`, and `CalendarComponent.java`.\n2.

Reminder.java (Support: 8, Confidence: 0.3076923076923077)\n   - Explanation: `Reminder.java` has a high support count and confidence from the co-change relationship with `SummaryData.java`, indicating that it is often modified when changes are made to `SummaryData.java`. This suggests a significant dependency between these two entities.\n\n2. SummaryPanel.java (Support: 8, Confidence: 0.3076923076923077)\n   - Explanation: Similar to `Reminder.java`, `SummaryPanel.java` also shows a strong co-change frequency and confidence with `SummaryData.java`. It is likely that both entities are closely related in functionality, requiring simultaneous updates.\n\n3. SummaryTree.java (Support: 6, Confidence: 0.23076923076923078)\n   - Explanation: With a considerable support count and confidence, `SummaryTree.java` appears frequently alongside `SummaryData.java` in past changes, suggesting that they share common functionality or dependencies that require concurrent modifications.\n\n4. Action.java (Support: 5, Confidence: 0.19230769230769232)\n   - Explanation: `Action.java` has been co-changed with `SummaryData.java` multiple times, implying a functional relationship that necessitates synchronized updates. Although its confidence is lower than the previous three, it still indicates a notable connection.\n\n5. CalendarComponent.java (Support: 3, Confidence: 0.11538461538461539)\n   - Explanation: Despite having fewer supports compared to the top four, `CalendarComponent.java` has shown some co-change patterns with `SummaryData.java`, which might indicate a shared context or usage scenario that requires attention during modifications.\n\n6. TaskList.java (Semantic similarity probability: 0.85048234)\n   - Explanation: Although there are no direct coupling dependencies between `TaskList.java` and `SummaryData.java`, their high semantic similarity suggests that they are conceptually linked. Changes to `SummaryData.java` may have implications for `TaskList.java`, making it essential to consider them together.\n\n7.

This implies that `Tracker.java` is highly likely to be affected by changes in `SummaryData.java`.\n\nBased on the analysis, these entities should be considered for synchronization when modifying `SummaryData.java`.

We identified several entities that have been frequently co-changed with `SummaryData.java`, such as `SummaryPanel.java`, `Reminder.java`, `SummaryTree.java`, `Action.java`, and `CalendarComponent.java`.\n2. From the call graph analysis, we found out that `SummaryData.java` references `TaskList.java`, `Tracker.java`, `MainWindow.java`, and `Vars.java`.\n3. Despite the lack of direct coupling dependencies, both `TaskList.java` and `Tracker.java` have shown strong conceptual coupling (`TaskList.java`) and high co-change frequency (`Tracker.java`) with `SummaryData.java`.\n\nBased on this information, the following entities should be considered for synchronization when changes are made to `SummaryData.java`:\n\n- `TaskList.java` (due to high conceptual coupling)\n- `Tracker.java` (due to high co-change frequency and confidence)\n- `SummaryPanel.java` (due to high co-change frequency and confidence)\n- `Reminder.java` (due to high co-change frequency and confidence)\n\nThese entities are likely to require updates in tandem with `SummaryData.java` based on historical change patterns and their relationships within the project.",

Reminder.java (Support: 8, Confidence: 0.3076923076923077)\n   - Explanation: `Reminder.java` has a high support count and confidence from the co-change relationship with `SummaryData.java`, indicating that it is often modified when changes are made to `SummaryData.java`. This suggests a significant dependency between these two entities.\n\n2. SummaryPanel.java (Support: 8, Confidence: 0.3076923076923077)\n   - Explanation: Similar to `Reminder.java`, `SummaryPanel.java` also shows a strong co-change frequency and confidence with `SummaryData.java`. It is likely that both entities are closely related in functionality, requiring simultaneous updates.\n\n3. SummaryTree.java (Support: 6, Confidence: 0.23076923076923078)\n   - Explanation: With a considerable support count and confidence, `SummaryTree.java` appears frequently alongside `SummaryData.java` in past changes, suggesting that they share common functionality or dependencies that require concurrent modifications.\n\n4. Action.java (Support: 5, Confidence: 0.19230769230769232)\n   - Explanation: `Action.java` has been co-changed with `SummaryData.java` multiple times, implying a functional relationship that necessitates synchronized updates. Although its confidence is lower than the previous three, it still indicates a notable connection.\n\n5. CalendarComponent.java (Support: 3, Confidence: 0.11538461538461539)\n   - Explanation: Despite having fewer supports compared to the top four, `CalendarComponent.java` has shown some co-change patterns with `SummaryData.java`, which might indicate a shared context or usage scenario that requires attention during modifications.\n\n6. TaskList.java (Semantic similarity probability: 0.85048234)\n   - Explanation: Although there are no direct coupling dependencies between `TaskList.java` and `SummaryData.java`, their high semantic similarity suggests that they are conceptually linked. Changes to `SummaryData.java` may have implications for `TaskList.java`, making it essential to consider them together.\n\n7. Tracker.java (Support: 8, Confidence: 0.3076923076923077)\n   - Explanation: While there are no direct coupling dependencies between `Tracker.java` and `SummaryData.java`, this entity has one of the highest co-change frequencies and confidence values. This implies that `Tracker.java` is highly likely to be affected by changes in `SummaryData.java`.\n\nBased on the analysis, these entities should be considered for synchronization when modifying `SummaryData.java`. The ordering reflects the combination of co-change relationships, confidence levels, and conceptual coupling where applicable.",

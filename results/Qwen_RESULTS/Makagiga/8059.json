It's possible that the co-change is due to other factors, such as being part of the same feature or module updates.\n\nSince we have exhausted our functional analysis options and have no more leads, I can conclude that the entity `MRadioButtonBeanInfo.java` should be synchronized with changes to `MRadioButton.java` based on historical co-change patterns. No other entities appear to be directly impacted by changes to `MRadioButton.java`. However, in real-world scenarios, further investigation into project documentation or communication with the development team might provide additional insights into why these files are modified together. \n\nIf there's anything else you would like to explore regarding this change impact analysis, please let me know!",

MRadioButtonBeanInfo.java: Based on the results from the `get_co_change_relationship` function, `MRadioButtonBeanInfo.java` has a strong historical co-change relationship with `MRadioButton.java`. The support count is 1 and the confidence is 1.0, which indicates that whenever `MRadioButton.java` was changed, `MRadioButtonBeanInfo.java` was also modified. Despite there being no coupling dependencies or conceptual similarity detected between these two entities, their co-change history suggests that they should be considered for synchronized changes. This might be due to them being part of the same feature or module, and thus any changes in `MRadioButton.java` may necessitate corresponding changes in `MRadioButtonBeanInfo.java`.\n\nThere were no other entities identified through our analysis that would require synchronization with `MRadioButton.java`. The call graph did not indicate any direct calls or references, and the lack of coupling dependencies or conceptual similarities further supports that `MRadioButtonBeanInfo.java` is the only entity that needs to be monitored for synchronized changes alongside `MRadioButton.java`.",

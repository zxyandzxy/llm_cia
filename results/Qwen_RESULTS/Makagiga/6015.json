Your task is to gradually explain which entity really need to be synchronized, based on the starting entity and the information obtained through the function-call.

Even though there are no direct coupling dependencies, it frequently co-changes with `FeedViewer.java`. It is also directly used by `FeedViewer.java`, making it a prime candidate for synchronized changes.\n\n2. **ArchiveChannel.java**: Similar to `WebBrowserEditor.java`, this entity shares a strong conceptual coupling with `FeedViewer.java` (probability of 0.829). Despite the lack of direct coupling dependencies, its frequent co-changes and semantic similarity suggest that any modifications to `FeedViewer.java` should consider potential impacts on `ArchiveChannel.java`.\n\n3. **FeedsFSPlugin.java**: With three instances of support and a confidence level of 0.12, this entity is one of the more frequently co-changed files alongside `FeedViewer.java`. Its higher support count indicates a moderate likelihood of requiring synchronization when changes are made to `FeedViewer.java`.\n\n4. **MFontButton.java, FeedsConfigPanel.java, FeedComponent.java, FeedUtils.java, BlockImageFactory.java, MTable.java, EnclosureAction.java, SaveAsAction.java**: Each of these entities has been modified together with `FeedViewer.java` two times, giving them a confidence score of 0.08. Although they have lower support counts compared to `FeedsFSPlugin.java`, their repeated co-occurrence in past changes suggests some level of dependency or common functionality that may require coordinated updates.\n\nThe elements in the Change set are sorted in descending order of the likelihood of synchronized modifications based on the combination of co-change frequency, confidence levels, and conceptual coupling. The first two entities (WebBrowserEditor.java and ArchiveChannel.java) are prioritized due to their high conceptual similarity and usage within `FeedViewer.java`.

Even though there are no direct coupling dependencies, it frequently co-changes with `FeedViewer.java`. It is also directly used by `FeedViewer.java`, making it a prime candidate for synchronized changes.\n\n2. **ArchiveChannel.java**: Similar to `WebBrowserEditor.java`, this entity shares a strong conceptual coupling with `FeedViewer.java` (probability of 0.829). Despite the lack of direct coupling dependencies, its frequent co-changes and semantic similarity suggest that any modifications to `FeedViewer.java` should consider potential impacts on `ArchiveChannel.java`.\n\n3. **FeedsFSPlugin.java**: With three instances of support and a confidence level of 0.12, this entity is one of the more frequently co-changed files alongside `FeedViewer.java`. Its higher support count indicates a moderate likelihood of requiring synchronization when changes are made to `FeedViewer.java`.\n\n4. **MFontButton.java, FeedsConfigPanel.java, FeedComponent.java, FeedUtils.java, BlockImageFactory.java, MTable.java, EnclosureAction.java, SaveAsAction.java**: Each of these entities has been modified together with `FeedViewer.java` two times, giving them a confidence score of 0.08. Although they have lower support counts compared to `FeedsFSPlugin.java`, their repeated co-occurrence in past changes suggests some level of dependency or common functionality that may require coordinated updates.\n\nThe elements in the Change set are sorted in descending order of the likelihood of synchronized modifications based on the combination of co-change frequency, confidence levels, and conceptual coupling. The first two entities (WebBrowserEditor.java and ArchiveChannel.java) are prioritized due to their high conceptual similarity and usage within `FeedViewer.java`. The rest follow based on decreasing co-change support and confidence scores.",

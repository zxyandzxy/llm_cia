For `SearchFS.java`, while the co-change frequency is notable, the lack of both coupling and conceptual relationships makes it less critical but still worth checking during the change impact analysis process.

For `SearchFS.java`, while the co-change frequency is notable, the lack of both coupling and conceptual relationships makes it less critical but still worth checking during the change impact analysis process.

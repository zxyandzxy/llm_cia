It suggests that whenever changes are made to `AbstractTextEditor.java`, `WebBrowserEditor.java` is very likely to require modifications as well.\n- **MText.java**: The `get_conceptual_coupling` function revealed a high semantic similarity probability of 0.835632 between `AbstractTextEditor.java` and `MText.java`. Given their conceptual relatedness, changes in `AbstractTextEditor.java` may necessitate corresponding updates in `MText.java`.\n- **Config.java**: Another entity with a significant conceptual relationship to `AbstractTextEditor.java`, having a semantic similarity probability of 0.82786703. Changes in configuration settings or behavior managed within `AbstractTextEditor.java` might require adjustments in `Config.java` as well.\n- **MScrollPane, MLogger, Flags, MMenu, MMouseAdapter, MToolBar, MClipboard, Focusable, PluginMenu**: These entities were identified through the call graph obtained from the `get_call_graph` function.

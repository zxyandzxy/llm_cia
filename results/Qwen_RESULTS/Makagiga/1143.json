In order to help solve the CIA mission, you should first understand some necessary concepts\uff1a\n(1)entity: Entities represent source code files in CIA tasks, and all the CIA tasks under study are based on the Java language, so entities are files with the .java extension.\n(2)starting entity: The starting entity is also called salient entity, and the salient entity is the root change that causes the modification of the rest of entities in a change set, while the rest of entities are the dependency modification along with the salient one.\nYou will be presented with a starting entity and tools (functions) will be provided to access the more information of the origin system. Your task is to gradually explain which entity really need to be synchronized, based on the starting entity and the information obtained through the function-call. You have 7 chances to call the function to get more information."

Even though there are no direct coupling dependencies, it appears in both the co-change analysis and call graph results, suggesting that changes to `TodoEditorCore.java` will likely require corresponding changes in `Tracker`.\n\n2. **CalendarWidget**: With a support count of 2 and confidence of 0.111, this entity is frequently modified alongside `TodoEditorCore.java`. The reason for its inclusion could be due to shared functionality or interaction within the application's user interface.\n\n3. **Summary**: Similar to `CalendarWidget`, it also has a support count of 2 and confidence of 0.111. It is probable that `Summary` shares some common features or dependencies with `TodoEditorCore.java`, which would necessitate synchronization during code changes.\n\n4. **NotepadEditorCore**: This entity has a support count of 2 and confidence of 0.111 as well. As part of the core editor functionalities, it may have related components or methods that interact with `TodoEditorCore.java`, making it a candidate for change synchronization.\n\n5. **TaskManager**: Despite having the highest support count (3) and confidence (0.166), it was found to be removed from the project's later iterations. Therefore, while it might have been important in the past, it is not relevant for current change impact analysis.\n\n6. **Task**: Also with a support count of 3 and confidence of 0.166, this entity is often changed together with `TodoEditorCore.java`. Given its central role in managing tasks, it is reasonable to assume that any changes affecting task management should consider updates to `Task` as well.\n\n7. **TodoEditor**: Like `Task`, it shares the same support count and confidence. As an editor specifically designed for todo items, it is closely related to `TodoEditorCore.java` and likely contains interdependencies that require synchronization when changes occur.\n\nEach of these entities needs to be considered for synchronization based on their historical co-change patterns, conceptual relationships, and functional connections with `TodoEditorCore.java`.

Even though there are no direct coupling dependencies, it appears in both the co-change analysis and call graph results, suggesting that changes to `TodoEditorCore.java` will likely require corresponding changes in `Tracker`.\n\n2. **CalendarWidget**: With a support count of 2 and confidence of 0.111, this entity is frequently modified alongside `TodoEditorCore.java`. The reason for its inclusion could be due to shared functionality or interaction within the application's user interface.\n\n3. **Summary**: Similar to `CalendarWidget`, it also has a support count of 2 and confidence of 0.111. It is probable that `Summary` shares some common features or dependencies with `TodoEditorCore.java`, which would necessitate synchronization during code changes.\n\n4. **NotepadEditorCore**: This entity has a support count of 2 and confidence of 0.111 as well. As part of the core editor functionalities, it may have related components or methods that interact with `TodoEditorCore.java`, making it a candidate for change synchronization.\n\n5. **TaskManager**: Despite having the highest support count (3) and confidence (0.166), it was found to be removed from the project's later iterations. Therefore, while it might have been important in the past, it is not relevant for current change impact analysis.\n\n6. **Task**: Also with a support count of 3 and confidence of 0.166, this entity is often changed together with `TodoEditorCore.java`. Given its central role in managing tasks, it is reasonable to assume that any changes affecting task management should consider updates to `Task` as well.\n\n7. **TodoEditor**: Like `Task`, it shares the same support count and confidence. As an editor specifically designed for todo items, it is closely related to `TodoEditorCore.java` and likely contains interdependencies that require synchronization when changes occur.\n\nEach of these entities needs to be considered for synchronization based on their historical co-change patterns, conceptual relationships, and functional connections with `TodoEditorCore.java`.

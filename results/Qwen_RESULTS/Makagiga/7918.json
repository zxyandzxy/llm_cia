Despite no explicit coupling dependencies, it is likely that changes to `Input.java` will require corresponding changes to `MIconChooser` due to their shared functionality or context.\n\n2. **DesktopSettings**: It also shows a co-change confidence of 0.5, indicating that whenever `Input.java` was modified, there was a significant chance that `DesktopSettings` needed to be updated as well. Although we did not find direct coupling dependencies between them, this pattern suggests they might share common requirements or contexts.\n\n3. **InternetSearchPanel**: Similar to `DesktopSettings`, it shares a co-change confidence of 0.5. The absence of explicit coupling does not rule out the possibility of related functionalities or configurations that necessitate concurrent updates.\n\n4. **MActionInfo & MFontChooser**: Both entities appear in the call graph of `Input.java`.

Despite no explicit coupling dependencies, it is likely that changes to `Input.java` will require corresponding changes to `MIconChooser` due to their shared functionality or context.\n\n2. **DesktopSettings**: It also shows a co-change confidence of 0.5, indicating that whenever `Input.java` was modified, there was a significant chance that `DesktopSettings` needed to be updated as well.

In order to help solve the CIA mission, you should first understand some necessary concepts\uff1a\n(1)entity: Entities represent source code files in CIA tasks, and all the CIA tasks under study are based on the Java language, so entities are files with the .java extension.\n(2)starting entity: The starting entity is also called salient entity, and the salient entity is the root change that causes the modification of the rest of entities in a change set, while the rest of entities are the dependency modification along with the salient one.\nYou will be presented with a starting entity and tools (functions) will be provided to access the more information of the origin system. Your task is to gradually explain which entity really need to be synchronized, based on the starting entity and the information obtained through the function-call. You have 7 chances to call the function to get more information."

Given the theme-related nature of both entities, changes affecting visual presentation might necessitate updates to `IconTheme.java`.\n\n6. **LAFInfo.java**: Co-changed once with `LookAndFeelSettings.java`. This file likely contains information pertinent to LookAndFeel, making it a candidate for synchronization when `LookAndFeelSettings.java` is modified.\n\n7. **AbstractIconLoader.java**: Co-changed once with `LookAndFeelSettings.java`. This class could be involved in loading icons used by the look and feel settings, hence requiring updates alongside `LookAndFeelSettings.java`.\n\n8. **PluginComboBox.java**: Co-changed once with `LookAndFeelSettings.java`. There's no evidence of coupling dependencies; however, the co-change history implies it might be impacted by changes to look and feel settings.\n\n9. **Info.java**: Co-changed once with `LookAndFeelSettings.java`.

Changes to `MToolBar` could directly affect `PropertiesBar`, making it crucial to synchronize any changes.\n\n2. **MainWindow**: Although there are no coupling dependencies between `MToolBar.java` and `MainWindow.java`, they share a high conceptual similarity (0.7056779). The co-change relationship also indicates that `MainWindow` has been modified along with `MToolBar` three times out of eight total modifications, giving it a confidence level of 0.3. Therefore, changes to `MToolBar` may necessitate corresponding changes in `MainWindow`.\n\n3. **ScriptYourself**: It shares a co-change relationship with `MToolBar` with a confidence level of 0.2, suggesting that these two entities have often been changed together in the past. While there's no evidence of direct coupling or conceptual relevance, this frequent co-change pattern justifies including it in the change set.\n\n4. **Entities from the call graph** (`MAction`, `MIcon`, `MColor`, `MLineBorder`, `WTFError`, `InvokedFromConstructor`, `Flags`, `UI`, `MMouseAdapter`, `TK`, `Mods`):\n   - These entities are directly used by `MToolBar` according to the call graph information. Any modification in `MToolBar` might impact how these entities are utilized, thus requiring them to be synchronized.\n   \n5. **Additional entities with low support and confidence** (`ActionGroup`, `AnnotationBar`, `ImageEditor`, `ZoomComponent`, `Widget`, `PluginManager`, `NoteWidget`, `LookAndFeelSettings`, `TestMButton`, `TestMLabel`, `ActionProperties`, `MLabel`, `MSearchPanel`, `MTextFieldPanel`, `Presentation`, `SearchBar`, `QuickOpenDialog`, `ChartPanel`, `PrintPreviewPanel`, `SummaryPanel`, `InternetSearchPanel`, `ControlPanel`, `VersionPanel`, `MFontButton`):\n   - These entities were identified through the co-change relationship function.

Changes to `MToolBar` could directly affect `PropertiesBar`, making it crucial to synchronize any changes.\n\n2. **MainWindow**: Although there are no coupling dependencies between `MToolBar.java` and `MainWindow.java`, they share a high conceptual similarity (0.7056779). The co-change relationship also indicates that `MainWindow` has been modified along with `MToolBar` three times out of eight total modifications, giving it a confidence level of 0.3. Therefore, changes to `MToolBar` may necessitate corresponding changes in `MainWindow`.\n\n3. **ScriptYourself**: It shares a co-change relationship with `MToolBar` with a confidence level of 0.2, suggesting that these two entities have often been changed together in the past. While there's no evidence of direct coupling or conceptual relevance, this frequent co-change pattern justifies including it in the change set.\n\n4. **Entities from the call graph** (`MAction`, `MIcon`, `MColor`, `MLineBorder`, `WTFError`, `InvokedFromConstructor`, `Flags`, `UI`, `MMouseAdapter`, `TK`, `Mods`):\n   - These entities are directly used by `MToolBar` according to the call graph information. Any modification in `MToolBar` might impact how these entities are utilized, thus requiring them to be synchronized.\n   \n5. **Additional entities with low support and confidence** (`ActionGroup`, `AnnotationBar`, `ImageEditor`, `ZoomComponent`, `Widget`, `PluginManager`, `NoteWidget`, `LookAndFeelSettings`, `TestMButton`, `TestMLabel`, `ActionProperties`, `MLabel`, `MSearchPanel`, `MTextFieldPanel`, `Presentation`, `SearchBar`, `QuickOpenDialog`, `ChartPanel`, `PrintPreviewPanel`, `SummaryPanel`, `InternetSearchPanel`, `ControlPanel`, `VersionPanel`, `MFontButton`):\n   - These entities were identified through the co-change relationship function.

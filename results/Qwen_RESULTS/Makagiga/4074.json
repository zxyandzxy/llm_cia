Additionally, it has a high conceptual coupling (semantic similarity probability of 0.837), indicating a strong relationship even without direct coupling dependencies. Therefore, changes to `Tracker.java` are very likely to necessitate corresponding changes in `SummaryData`.\n\n2. **FSHelper**: It appears twice alongside `Tracker.java` in the version history with a confidence of 0.167. While there is no direct coupling dependency, its repeated appearance in co-changes suggests that it might be involved in related functionalities or workflows.\n\n3. **MainWindow**: Similar to `FSHelper`, it has been changed together with `Tracker.java` twice, showing a confidence of 0.167. As part of the main interface, it could be indirectly affected by changes in `Tracker.java`.\n\n4. **Tree**: This entity also shares two co-changes with `Tracker.java` and has a confidence of 0.167. It may be used in presenting data managed by `Tracker.java`, making it a candidate for synchronization.\n\n5. **TrackerItem**: Co-changed twice with `Tracker.java` (confidence 0.167). Given its name, it seems closely related to `Tracker.java`'s functionality and should be considered for synchronization.\n\n6. **TodoEditorPlugin**: Appears twice in co-changes with a confidence of 0.167. Though there's no direct coupling, it could be part of the same feature set as `Tracker.java`.\n\nEntities like **TaskSelection**, **DefaultPreview**, **ImagePrintable**, **VersionInfo**, **TodoEditorCore**, **SummaryPanel**, **Armor**, **Permission**, **SessionManager**, **Links**, **MetaInfo**, **TaskModel**, **TaskReader**, **Editor**, and **Query** have lower support counts and confidences, but they still show up in the co-change history with `Tracker.java`. They may need to be reviewed for potential impacts from changes in `Tracker.java`, although their necessity for synchronization is less certain than the entities listed above.\n\nAdditionally, based on the call graph analysis, the following directly referenced or used entities should always be checked for updates when modifying `Tracker.java`: **MetaInfo**, **MLogger**, **MTimer**, **Uninstantiable**, **TaskTable**, and **TK**. These entities have an immediate dependency on `Tracker.java` and will require attention during any change process. However, since these were not part of the co-change analysis, they are mentioned separately but should be prioritized due to their direct usage within `Tracker.java`. \n\nPlease note that while the change set lists entities that are likely candidates for synchronized modifications, actual requirements for synchronization would depend on the specific nature of the changes being made to `Tracker.java`.",

Your task is to gradually explain which entity really need to be synchronized, based on the starting entity and the information obtained through the function-call.

Moreover, it has a high conceptual coupling probability (0.84), indicating that these two entities share similar functionalities or purposes. Therefore, changes to `TaskModel.java` will likely require corresponding changes in `TaskTable`.\n\n2. **AbstractListTableModel**: This entity shows a moderate co-change relationship with `TaskModel.java`, having a support of 2 and confidence of 0.33. Although there is no direct coupling dependency or significant conceptual similarity detected, its co-change history suggests a potential need for synchronization during modifications.\n\n3. **TodoEditorCore, TodoEditorPlugin, IconTheme, CommentsAction, TodoEditor, Node, ColumnManager, SummaryData, SummaryTree, Renderer, DeletePrivateDataPlugin, MTableHeader, Sorter, TaskComparator, Model**: Each of these entities has been changed alongside `TaskModel.java` at least once, with a support of 1 and a confidence of 0.17. While their relationships may not be as strong as those of `TaskTable` or `AbstractListTableModel`, they still represent entities that could be affected by changes in `TaskModel.java`. They should be reviewed when modifying `TaskModel.java` due to their past co-change occurrences.\n\nIn conclusion, while `TaskTable` is the most critical entity to synchronize with `TaskModel.java` based on co-change analysis and conceptual coupling, other entities listed in the change set should also be considered for potential modifications. The decision to modify them should be made after reviewing the specific context and nature of the changes being made to `TaskModel.java`.",

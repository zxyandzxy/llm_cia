In order to help solve the CIA mission, you should first understand some necessary concepts\uff1a\n(1)entity: Entities represent source code files in CIA tasks, and all the CIA tasks under study are based on the Java language, so entities are files with the .java extension.\n(2)starting entity: The starting entity is also called salient entity, and the salient entity is the root change that causes the modification of the rest of entities in a change set, while the rest of entities are the dependency modification along with the salient one.\nYou will be presented with a starting entity and tools (functions) will be provided to access the more information of the origin system. Your task is to gradually explain which entity really need to be synchronized, based on the starting entity and the information obtained through the function-call. You have 7 chances to call the function to get more information."

Moreover, it has a relatively high conceptual coupling score with `MMenu.java` (0.706), indicating that they share significant semantic similarity. Changes in `MMenu.java` may require changes in `MainWindow.java` due to their functional interdependence.\n\n2. **TreePanel.java**: The conceptual coupling between `MMenu.java` and `TreePanel.java` is even higher than with `MainWindow.java` (0.852). Although the support count for co-changes is lower (Supports: 4, Confidence: 0.14), the strong conceptual relationship suggests that these two entities should be changed together.\n\n3. **TagsMenu.java**: With a support count of 4 and a confidence of 0.14, this entity frequently co-changes with `MMenu.java`. While we do not have direct evidence of structural or conceptual coupling, the co-change pattern justifies including it in the change set.\n\n4. **ScriptExecutor.java**: This entity is directly called by `MMenu.java`, as determined by the call graph analysis. Although there are no coupling dependencies, the direct call relationship means that changes in `MMenu.java` might affect `ScriptExecutor.java`.\n\n5. **InternetSearchPanel.java**: Although this entity was initially considered for its high support count and confidence (Supports: 5, Confidence: 0.17), it has been removed from the project in newer iterations. Thus, while it was part of the historical co-change pattern, it is no longer relevant for current change impact analysis.\n\nPlease note that `InternetSearchPanel.java` should not be included in the final change set since it has been removed from the project. The final change set should therefore exclude `InternetSearchPanel.java` and include only those entities that are present in the current version of the project.",

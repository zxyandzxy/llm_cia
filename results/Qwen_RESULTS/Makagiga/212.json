Mnemonic.java:\n   - Support Count: 1\n   - Confidence Level: 0.5\n   Although there are no direct coupling dependencies between `MouseGestures.java` and `Mnemonic.java`, they exhibit a high conceptual similarity (approximately 0.813). This semantic overlap indicates that these two entities share significant functional or conceptual aspects, which is likely the reason behind their historical co-changes. Given this strong conceptual relationship, changes to `MouseGestures.java` should prompt a review of `Mnemonic.java` for potential synchronized modifications.\n\n2. Index.java:\n   - Support Count: 1\n   - Confidence Level: 0.5\n   Similar to `Mnemonic.java`, there are no direct coupling dependencies between `MouseGestures.java` and `Index.java`. However, the conceptual similarity between these two files is also quite high (approximately 0.816), indicating a shared purpose or closely related functionality within the project. The high semantic overlap supports the notion that these files have been changed together in the past and should be considered for synchronized changes when modifications are made to `MouseGestures.java`.\n\nIn conclusion, due to the strong conceptual relationships and historical co-change patterns, it is recommended to synchronize changes with both `Mnemonic.java` and `Index.java` when working with `MouseGestures.java`.

This semantic overlap indicates that these two entities share significant functional or conceptual aspects, which is likely the reason behind their historical co-changes. Given this strong conceptual relationship, changes to `MouseGestures.java` should prompt a review of `Mnemonic.java` for potential synchronized modifications.\n\n2. Index.java:\n   - Support Count: 1\n   - Confidence Level: 0.5\n   Similar to `Mnemonic.java`, there are no direct coupling dependencies between `MouseGestures.java` and `Index.java`. However, the conceptual similarity between these two files is also quite high (approximately 0.816), indicating a shared purpose or closely related functionality within the project. The high semantic overlap supports the notion that these files have been changed together in the past and should be considered for synchronized changes when modifications are made to `MouseGestures.java`.\n\nIn conclusion, due to the strong conceptual relationships and historical co-change patterns, it is recommended to synchronize changes with both `Mnemonic.java` and `Index.java` when working with `MouseGestures.java`.

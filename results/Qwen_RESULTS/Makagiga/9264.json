In order to help solve the CIA mission, you should first understand some necessary concepts\uff1a\n(1)entity: Entities represent source code files in CIA tasks, and all the CIA tasks under study are based on the Java language, so entities are files with the .java extension.\n(2)starting entity: The starting entity is also called salient entity, and the salient entity is the root change that causes the modification of the rest of entities in a change set, while the rest of entities are the dependency modification along with the salient one.\nYou will be presented with a starting entity and tools (functions) will be provided to access the more information of the origin system. Your task is to gradually explain which entity really need to be synchronized, based on the starting entity and the information obtained through the function-call. You have 7 chances to call the function to get more information."

This is similar to what we observed with `CalendarWidget.java`.\n\nSince the direct coupling analysis has not been fruitful so far, let's try a different approach. We can look at the call graph for `MCalendarPanel.java` to identify any files that directly use or are used by `MCalendarPanel.java`. This could give us more insights into which entities might need to be synchronized when changes occur in `MCalendarPanel.java`.\n\nLet's now call the `get_call_graph` function for `MCalendarPanel.java`.",

This will help us understand which ones are more likely to require synchronization when changes are made to `MCalendarPanel.java`.\n\nLet's check the co-change relationship of one of the most relevant-looking entities from the call graph, `MCalendar.java`, with `MCalendarPanel.java`.\n\nNow, I will call the `get_co_change_relationship` function for `MCalendar.java`.",

This indicates that changes in `MCalendarPanel.java` have historically been accompanied by changes in `CalendarWidget.java`, suggesting a high likelihood of synchronized modifications.\n  \n- `SummaryData`: This entity appeared 5 times alongside `MCalendarPanel.java` during past code modifications, with a confidence level of 0.217. Despite the lack of coupling dependencies, its frequent appearance during co-changes makes it a candidate for potential synchronization needs.\n  \n- `DayButton`: Similar to `SummaryData`, this entity also showed up 5 times in the co-change history with `MCalendarPanel.java`. However, it has since been removed from the project, so it is not included in the final change set for synchronization.\n\n- `MDate`: This entity appears in the call graph of `MCalendarPanel.java`, indicating that it is directly or indirectly used by `MCalendarPanel.java`. Since it's related to date functionality, which is crucial for a calendar panel, any changes in `MCalendarPanel.java` might require corresponding changes in `MDate`.\n\n- `MCalendar`: This entity is central to the calendar functionalities within the application and appears in the call graph of `MCalendarPanel.java`.

This means that every time \"HelpSystem.java\" was changed, \"Help.java\" was also modified. Additionally, the `get_conceptual_coupling` function returned a high semantic similarity probability of approximately 0.802, indicating a strong conceptual connection between the two files. Therefore, it is highly likely that changes to \"HelpSystem.java\" will require corresponding changes in \"Help.java\".\n\n2. **DefaultHelpSystem**: According to the `get_co_change_relationship` function, \"DefaultHelpSystem.java\" also shares a co-change relationship with \"HelpSystem.java\", having 1 support and a confidence level of 1.0. However, upon checking for coupling dependencies using `get_coupling_dependencies`, it was revealed that \"DefaultHelpSystem.java\" has been removed from the project due to project version iteration.

Additionally, the `get_conceptual_coupling` function returned a high semantic similarity probability of approximately 0.802, indicating a strong conceptual connection between the two files. Therefore, it is highly likely that changes to \"HelpSystem.java\" will require corresponding changes in \"Help.java\".\n\n2. **DefaultHelpSystem**: According to the `get_co_change_relationship` function, \"DefaultHelpSystem.java\" also shares a co-change relationship with \"HelpSystem.java\", having 1 support and a confidence level of 1.0. However, upon checking for coupling dependencies using `get_coupling_dependencies`, it was revealed that \"DefaultHelpSystem.java\" has been removed from the project due to project version iteration. Despite its past co-change pattern with \"HelpSystem.java\", it no longer exists within the current project structure, making it irrelevant for synchronization.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the analysis performed, only \"Help.java\" should be considered for synchronized changes alongside \"HelpSystem.java\".

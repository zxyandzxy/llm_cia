In order to help solve the CIA mission, you should first understand some necessary concepts\uff1a\n(1)entity: Entities represent source code files in CIA tasks, and all the CIA tasks under study are based on the Java language, so entities are files with the .java extension.\n(2)starting entity: The starting entity is also called salient entity, and the salient entity is the root change that causes the modification of the rest of entities in a change set, while the rest of entities are the dependency modification along with the salient one.\nYou will be presented with a starting entity and tools (functions) will be provided to access the more information of the origin system. Your task is to gradually explain which entity really need to be synchronized, based on the starting entity and the information obtained through the function-call. You have 7 chances to call the function to get more information."

Although there are no direct coupling dependencies or conceptual similarities detected, it may be part of the same user interface module or have shared functionality within the application's main window context.\n\n- **ExtraKiosk.java**: With 4 supports and a confidence level of 0.5, this entity also frequently changes with `Kiosk.java`. Despite the lack of coupling dependencies between them, it could indicate that they are related through common features or configuration settings that affect both entities similarly.\n\n- **MURLButton.java**: Having been co-changed 3 times with `Kiosk.java`, and a confidence level of 0.375, it suggests a potential relationship in terms of handling URLs or providing similar functionality. The absence of coupling dependencies might mean that any interaction occurs indirectly or via shared external factors.\n\n- **MText.java**: Co-changed twice with `Kiosk.java` and a confidence level of 0.25, this entity might share some functionality or configuration options with `Kiosk.java`, even though no semantic similarity was found. It could be involved in text processing or display functionalities that are influenced by changes in `Kiosk.java`.\n\n- **ChartDialog.java**: This entity has been co-changed twice with `Kiosk.java`, showing a confidence level of 0.25. It may involve presenting data visualizations or reports which can be impacted by changes in Kiosk mode configurations or behaviors.\n\n- **TaskTable.java**: Similar to other entities mentioned above, this one has been co-changed twice with `Kiosk.java` and has a confidence level of 0.25. It could relate to task management or list views that need to adapt according to the kiosk environment settings.\n\nIn conclusion, while we did not find direct code-level dependencies or strong conceptual couplings, the co-change analysis suggests that these entities are often modified together due to their roles in the system architecture, shared feature sets, or involvement in common workflows within the application. Therefore, when making changes to `Kiosk.java`, it is advisable to consider synchronizing those changes with these entities to ensure consistency across the related functionalities.",

It may involve presenting data visualizations or reports which can be impacted by changes in Kiosk mode configurations or behaviors.\n\n- **TaskTable.java**: Similar to other entities mentioned above, this one has been co-changed twice with `Kiosk.java` and has a confidence level of 0.25. It could relate to task management or list views that need to adapt according to the kiosk environment settings.\n\nIn conclusion, while we did not find direct code-level dependencies or strong conceptual couplings, the co-change analysis suggests that these entities are often modified together due to their roles in the system architecture, shared feature sets, or involvement in common workflows within the application. Therefore, when making changes to `Kiosk.java`, it is advisable to consider synchronizing those changes with these entities to ensure consistency across the related functionalities.",

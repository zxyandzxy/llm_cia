Additionally, it has a high conceptual coupling probability with \"InternetSearchPanel.java\" (0.737), indicating that these two entities share similar functionalities or purposes and often change together.\n\n2. **CustomSearchAction**: This entity appears twice in the co-change history with \"InternetSearchPanel.java\", giving it a support count of 2 and a confidence of 0.222. Although there is no direct coupling dependency, its repeated appearance suggests a need for synchronization when changes occur.\n\n3. **InternetSearchAction**: Similar to \"CustomSearchAction\", this entity also has a support count of 2 and a confidence of 0.222. It's likely involved in related functionality within the application, requiring attention during modifications.\n\n4. **Action**: With a support count of 2 and a confidence of 0.222, this entity shows up frequently alongside \"InternetSearchPanel.java\". Despite the lack of detailed information about its specific interactions, its recurring presence indicates a possible need for coordinated changes.\n\n5. **PluginDownloader**: This entity appeared both in the co-change list and the call graph of \"InternetSearchPanel.java\". Though there are no direct coupling dependencies, its usage within \"InternetSearchPanel\" suggests that changes might affect it.\n\n6. **GeneralSettings**: This entity has been modified alongside \"InternetSearchPanel.java\" once, showing a support count of 1 and a confidence of 0.111. Its inclusion may be due to shared configurations or settings relevant to the internet search functionality.\n\n7. **ProxySettings**: Like \"GeneralSettings\", this entity has a support count of 1 and a confidence of 0.111. It could be involved in configuring proxy settings necessary for the operation of the internet search panel.\n\n8. **IconTheme**: With a single occurrence in the co-change history, this entity might be related to the visual representation or theming of the search panel interface.\n\n9. **OpenSearchDescription**: Having a support count of 1 and a confidence of 0.111, this entity might define the structure or format of search descriptions used by the panel.\n\n10. **FeedUtils**: Also appearing once in the co-change history, this utility class could provide functionality related to handling RSS feeds or other data feeds integrated into the search panel.\n\n11. **Database**: With only one occurrence, this entity might relate to storing or retrieving data pertinent to the internet search operations.\n\n12. **SnippetAction**: Lastly, this entity shares a low support count and confidence but could be part of the broader actions available in the search panel interface.\n\nIn summary, the change set includes entities that have shown a tendency to change alongside \"InternetSearchPanel.java\" based on historical version control data.

Additionally, it has a high conceptual coupling probability with \"InternetSearchPanel.java\" (0.737), indicating that these two entities share similar functionalities or purposes and often change together.\n\n2. **CustomSearchAction**: This entity appears twice in the co-change history with \"InternetSearchPanel.java\", giving it a support count of 2 and a confidence of 0.222. Although there is no direct coupling dependency, its repeated appearance suggests a need for synchronization when changes occur.\n\n3. **InternetSearchAction**: Similar to \"CustomSearchAction\", this entity also has a support count of 2 and a confidence of 0.222. It's likely involved in related functionality within the application, requiring attention during modifications.\n\n4. **Action**: With a support count of 2 and a confidence of 0.222, this entity shows up frequently alongside \"InternetSearchPanel.java\". Despite the lack of detailed information about its specific interactions, its recurring presence indicates a possible need for coordinated changes.\n\n5. **PluginDownloader**: This entity appeared both in the co-change list and the call graph of \"InternetSearchPanel.java\". Though there are no direct coupling dependencies, its usage within \"InternetSearchPanel\" suggests that changes might affect it.\n\n6. **GeneralSettings**: This entity has been modified alongside \"InternetSearchPanel.java\" once, showing a support count of 1 and a confidence of 0.111. Its inclusion may be due to shared configurations or settings relevant to the internet search functionality.\n\n7. **ProxySettings**: Like \"GeneralSettings\", this entity has a support count of 1 and a confidence of 0.111. It could be involved in configuring proxy settings necessary for the operation of the internet search panel.\n\n8. **IconTheme**: With a single occurrence in the co-change history, this entity might be related to the visual representation or theming of the search panel interface.\n\n9. **OpenSearchDescription**: Having a support count of 1 and a confidence of 0.111, this entity might define the structure or format of search descriptions used by the panel.\n\n10. **FeedUtils**: Also appearing once in the co-change history, this utility class could provide functionality related to handling RSS feeds or other data feeds integrated into the search panel.\n\n11. **Database**: With only one occurrence, this entity might relate to storing or retrieving data pertinent to the internet search operations.\n\n12. **SnippetAction**: Lastly, this entity shares a low support count and confidence but could be part of the broader actions available in the search panel interface.\n\nIn summary, the change set includes entities that have shown a tendency to change alongside \"InternetSearchPanel.java\" based on historical version control data.

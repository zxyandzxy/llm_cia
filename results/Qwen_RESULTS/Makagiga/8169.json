Furthermore, it has been co-changed with MFrame.java every time there was a modification (support: 1, confidence: 1.0). This strong pattern of co-change and high conceptual coupling suggests that MouseGestures should be prioritized for synchronization whenever changes are made to MFrame.java.\n\n2. **Help**:\n   - Help has also been co-changed with MFrame.java every time (support: 1, confidence: 1.0). Although no direct coupling dependencies or conceptual similarities were found, the consistent co-change pattern implies that Help may need to be updated alongside MFrame.java due to their functional interdependence within the system.\n\n3. **MainWindow**:\n   - Similar to Help, MainWindow shares a co-change relationship with MFrame.java (support: 1, confidence: 1.0). Despite the lack of detected coupling dependencies or conceptual relations, the fact that it has been changed concurrently with MFrame.java suggests that any changes in MFrame.java might require corresponding adjustments in MainWindow.\n\n4. **CustomMouseGestures**:\n   - CustomMouseGestures is listed as being co-changed with MFrame.java every time (support: 1, confidence: 1.0). While there is no evidence of coupling or conceptual connection, its inclusion in the co-change history points towards potential synchronization needs when modifying MFrame.java.\n\nIn summary, while MouseGestures stands out due to its high conceptual similarity and clear co-change history, the other entities\u2014Help, MainWindow, and CustomMouseGestures\u2014are also recommended for synchronization based on their historical co-change patterns. Careful consideration should be given to these entities during the change impact analysis process to ensure that all necessary updates are accounted for.",

Although `Help`, `MainWindow`, and `CustomMouseGestures` have shown co-change patterns, without further evidence of coupling or conceptual relations, they may require additional investigation beyond what can be done within our remaining function calls.\n\nIf more information were needed for a thorough analysis, one could look into the project's documentation, examine recent changes in the version history, or perform additional code reviews focusing on these entities.

Furthermore, it has been co-changed with MFrame.java every time there was a modification (support: 1, confidence: 1.0). This strong pattern of co-change and high conceptual coupling suggests that MouseGestures should be prioritized for synchronization whenever changes are made to MFrame.java.\n\n2. **Help**:\n   - Help has also been co-changed with MFrame.java every time (support: 1, confidence: 1.0). Although no direct coupling dependencies or conceptual similarities were found, the consistent co-change pattern implies that Help may need to be updated alongside MFrame.java due to their functional interdependence within the system.\n\n3. **MainWindow**:\n   - Similar to Help, MainWindow shares a co-change relationship with MFrame.java (support: 1, confidence: 1.0). Despite the lack of detected coupling dependencies or conceptual relations, the fact that it has been changed concurrently with MFrame.java suggests that any changes in MFrame.java might require corresponding adjustments in MainWindow.\n\n4. **CustomMouseGestures**:\n   - CustomMouseGestures is listed as being co-changed with MFrame.java every time (support: 1, confidence: 1.0). While there is no evidence of coupling or conceptual connection, its inclusion in the co-change history points towards potential synchronization needs when modifying MFrame.java.\n\nIn summary, while MouseGestures stands out due to its high conceptual similarity and clear co-change history, the other entities\u2014Help, MainWindow, and CustomMouseGestures\u2014are also recommended for synchronization based on their historical co-change patterns. Careful consideration should be given to these entities during the change impact analysis process to ensure that all necessary updates are accounted for.",

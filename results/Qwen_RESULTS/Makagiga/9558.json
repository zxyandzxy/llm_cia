Furthermore, it shares a high semantic similarity probability of approximately 0.84 with `TaskModel.java`. Despite no direct coupling dependencies or call references, these two files are closely related in functionality and should be modified together to ensure consistency.\n\n2. **AbstractListTableModel.java**: With a support count of 2 and a confidence level of 0.33, this entity shows some degree of co-change with `TaskModel.java`. It may share similar functionalities or patterns that make it likely to require updates when changes occur in `TaskModel.java`.\n\n3. **TodoEditorPlugin.java**: Similarly to `AbstractListTableModel.java`, this entity has a support count of 2 and a confidence level of 0.33. It might have functional relationships or dependencies with `TaskModel.java` that necessitate concurrent modifications.\n\n4. **Sorter.java**: Although having a lower support count of 1 and a confidence level of 0.17, `Sorter.java` still appears in the co-change history with `TaskModel.java`. Its presence suggests potential interactions or shared responsibilities within the application that warrant consideration during modifications.\n\n5. **TodoEditorCore.java**: Like `Sorter.java`, this entity has a support count of 1 and a confidence level of 0.17. Given its appearance in the co-change data, it could be indirectly affected by changes in `TaskModel.java`, especially if they share common interfaces or functionalities.\n\n6. **IconTheme.java**: With a support count of 1 and a confidence level of 0.17, this entity has a weaker but noticeable co-change relationship with `TaskModel.java`. While the reasons for this co-change are less clear, it's prudent to consider updating it alongside `TaskModel.java` to avoid potential inconsistencies.\n\n7. **CommentsAction.java**: Lastly, this entity also has a support count of 1 and a confidence level of 0.17. It might be involved in scenarios where changes to `TaskModel.java` would impact how comments or annotations are handled, making it another candidate for synchronized modifications.\n\nThe elements in the Change set are sorted in descending order of the likelihood of synchronized modifications based on their support counts and confidence levels, with additional consideration given to the conceptual coupling between `TaskModel.java` and `TaskTable.java`.",

Furthermore, it shares a high semantic similarity probability of approximately 0.84 with `TaskModel.java`. Despite no direct coupling dependencies or call references, these two files are closely related in functionality and should be modified together to ensure consistency.\n\n2. **AbstractListTableModel.java**: With a support count of 2 and a confidence level of 0.33, this entity shows some degree of co-change with `TaskModel.java`. It may share similar functionalities or patterns that make it likely to require updates when changes occur in `TaskModel.java`.\n\n3. **TodoEditorPlugin.java**: Similarly to `AbstractListTableModel.java`, this entity has a support count of 2 and a confidence level of 0.33. It might have functional relationships or dependencies with `TaskModel.java` that necessitate concurrent modifications.\n\n4. **Sorter.java**: Although having a lower support count of 1 and a confidence level of 0.17, `Sorter.java` still appears in the co-change history with `TaskModel.java`. Its presence suggests potential interactions or shared responsibilities within the application that warrant consideration during modifications.\n\n5. **TodoEditorCore.java**: Like `Sorter.java`, this entity has a support count of 1 and a confidence level of 0.17. Given its appearance in the co-change data, it could be indirectly affected by changes in `TaskModel.java`, especially if they share common interfaces or functionalities.\n\n6. **IconTheme.java**: With a support count of 1 and a confidence level of 0.17, this entity has a weaker but noticeable co-change relationship with `TaskModel.java`. While the reasons for this co-change are less clear, it's prudent to consider updating it alongside `TaskModel.java` to avoid potential inconsistencies.\n\n7. **CommentsAction.java**: Lastly, this entity also has a support count of 1 and a confidence level of 0.17. It might be involved in scenarios where changes to `TaskModel.java` would impact how comments or annotations are handled, making it another candidate for synchronized modifications.\n\nThe elements in the Change set are sorted in descending order of the likelihood of synchronized modifications based on their support counts and confidence levels, with additional consideration given to the conceptual coupling between `TaskModel.java` and `TaskTable.java`.",

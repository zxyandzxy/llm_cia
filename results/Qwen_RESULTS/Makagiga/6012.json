Your task is to gradually explain which entity really need to be synchronized, based on the starting entity and the information obtained through the function-call.

Moreover, it has the highest number of supports (9) and confidence level (0.346) among all co-changed entities. This high support count and conceptual similarity suggest that TaskTable is likely to require synchronized modifications whenever there are changes in MTable.java.\n\n2. **TodoEditorCore**: With a conceptual coupling probability of 0.84168965, TodoEditorCore also exhibits a close functional relationship with MTable.java. It has been modified alongside MTable.java six times out of eight possible instances, resulting in a confidence level of 0.231. Given this data, it is prudent to consider TodoEditorCore for synchronized changes.\n\n3. **ColumnManager**: The conceptual coupling between MTable.java and ColumnManager is even higher than that of the previous two entities, at 0.8636651. Although it appears slightly less frequently in co-change history (with four supports and a confidence level of 0.154), its high conceptual similarity suggests that it should be included in the synchronization process.\n\n4. **RowIterator**: RowIterator has appeared three times in the co-change history with MTable.java, giving it a confidence level of 0.115. While the conceptual coupling wasn't explicitly checked for RowIterator due to limited function calls, its presence in co-change history justifies including it in the change set as it may have dependencies not captured by the other metrics used.\n\n5. **TodoEditor**: Similar to TodoEditorCore, TodoEditor shares a significant co-change frequency with six supports and a confidence level of 0.231. Despite not checking its conceptual coupling due to the limit of function calls, its frequent appearance in the co-change records indicates a need for synchronization when changes occur in MTable.java.\n\nThe elements in the Change set are sorted in descending order of the likelihood of synchronized modifications based on their support counts, confidence levels, and where applicable, conceptual coupling probabilities.

Therefore, changes to `MTable.java` are likely to necessitate corresponding changes in `TodoEditorCore`.\n\nGiven the high conceptual coupling and co-change frequency, both `TaskTable` and `TodoEditorCore` should be considered for synchronization when making changes to `MTable.java`.\n\nSince we have one more chance to gather information, let's investigate the relationship between `MTable.java` and `ColumnManager`, which had a moderate support count and confidence level in the co-change analysis.

Moreover, it has the highest number of supports (9) and confidence level (0.346) among all co-changed entities. This high support count and conceptual similarity suggest that TaskTable is likely to require synchronized modifications whenever there are changes in MTable.java.\n\n2. **TodoEditorCore**: With a conceptual coupling probability of 0.84168965, TodoEditorCore also exhibits a close functional relationship with MTable.java. It has been modified alongside MTable.java six times out of eight possible instances, resulting in a confidence level of 0.231. Given this data, it is prudent to consider TodoEditorCore for synchronized changes.\n\n3. **ColumnManager**: The conceptual coupling between MTable.java and ColumnManager is even higher than that of the previous two entities, at 0.8636651. Although it appears slightly less frequently in co-change history (with four supports and a confidence level of 0.154), its high conceptual similarity suggests that it should be included in the synchronization process.\n\n4. **RowIterator**: RowIterator has appeared three times in the co-change history with MTable.java, giving it a confidence level of 0.115. While the conceptual coupling wasn't explicitly checked for RowIterator due to limited function calls, its presence in co-change history justifies including it in the change set as it may have dependencies not captured by the other metrics used.\n\n5. **TodoEditor**: Similar to TodoEditorCore, TodoEditor shares a significant co-change frequency with six supports and a confidence level of 0.231. Despite not checking its conceptual coupling due to the limit of function calls, its frequent appearance in the co-change records indicates a need for synchronization when changes occur in MTable.java.\n\nThe elements in the Change set are sorted in descending order of the likelihood of synchronized modifications based on their support counts, confidence levels, and where applicable, conceptual coupling probabilities. Entities with higher support counts and stronger conceptual relationships are prioritized for synchronization.",

Additionally, it has a high conceptual coupling probability of 0.8446934. It suggests that although there are no direct code dependencies, both files share a significant amount of semantic similarity which might indicate they are conceptually related or part of similar features.\n\n2. **CompleteRenderer.java**: Similar to `MSplashScreen.java`, this entity also has a strong co-change relationship with `SimpleProgressBar.java` (with support count 1 and confidence 1.0) and an even slightly higher conceptual coupling probability of 0.8455375. The high semantic similarity indicates that these two entities may need to be updated together to maintain consistency in their functionality or to address similar changes in requirements.\n\n3. **SessionManager.java**: This entity shares the same co-change relationship strength as the other two (support count 1 and confidence 1.0), but it has a lower conceptual coupling probability of 0.80430424. Despite the lower similarity score, it still indicates a significant relationship suggesting that `SessionManager.java` should be considered for synchronized changes when modifying `SimpleProgressBar.java`. However, it ranks third due to its relatively lower semantic similarity compared to the other two entities.\n\nIn summary, given the strong co-change relationships and notable conceptual similarities, `MSplashScreen.java`, `CompleteRenderer.java`, and `SessionManager.java` are likely to require synchronization with `SimpleProgressBar.java` during modifications.

Additionally, it has a high conceptual coupling probability of 0.8446934. It suggests that although there are no direct code dependencies, both files share a significant amount of semantic similarity which might indicate they are conceptually related or part of similar features.\n\n2. **CompleteRenderer.java**: Similar to `MSplashScreen.java`, this entity also has a strong co-change relationship with `SimpleProgressBar.java` (with support count 1 and confidence 1.0) and an even slightly higher conceptual coupling probability of 0.8455375. The high semantic similarity indicates that these two entities may need to be updated together to maintain consistency in their functionality or to address similar changes in requirements.\n\n3. **SessionManager.java**: This entity shares the same co-change relationship strength as the other two (support count 1 and confidence 1.0), but it has a lower conceptual coupling probability of 0.80430424. Despite the lower similarity score, it still indicates a significant relationship suggesting that `SessionManager.java` should be considered for synchronized changes when modifying `SimpleProgressBar.java`. However, it ranks third due to its relatively lower semantic similarity compared to the other two entities.\n\nIn summary, given the strong co-change relationships and notable conceptual similarities, `MSplashScreen.java`, `CompleteRenderer.java`, and `SessionManager.java` are likely to require synchronization with `SimpleProgressBar.java` during modifications.

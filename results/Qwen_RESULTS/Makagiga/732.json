Although there are no direct coupling dependencies between them, the co-change frequency suggests that changes to `MToolBar.java` often coincide with changes to `MainWindow`.\n\n2. **PropertiesBar**: Co-changed 2 times with `MToolBar.java`, with a confidence of 0.2. This indicates a moderate probability that changes to `MToolBar.java` may require adjustments to `PropertiesBar`.\n\n3. **ScriptYourself**: Also co-changed 2 times with `MToolBar.java`, with a confidence of 0.2. Similar to `PropertiesBar`, this implies that `ScriptYourself` might need to be reviewed when `MToolBar.java` is modified.\n\n4. **ScriptUtils**: Directly referenced by `MToolBar.java` according to the call graph analysis and has a high conceptual coupling score of 0.830214. This combination of direct usage and semantic similarity strongly suggests that `ScriptUtils` should be included in any synchronization effort.\n\n5. **NotepadEditor**: Co-changed once with `MToolBar.java`, with a confidence of 0.1. It has a lower likelihood of requiring changes but has appeared in the change history alongside `MToolBar.java`.\n\n6. **IconButton**: Co-changed once with `MToolBar.java`, with a confidence of 0.1. The low confidence value means it's less likely to need synchronization, but its appearance in the change history warrants attention.\n\n7. **PluginManager**: Co-changed once with `MToolBar.java`, with a confidence of 0.1. While the confidence is low, considering it could be part of the same toolbar or GUI system, it might be affected by changes to `MToolBar.java`.\n\n8. **SearchBar**: Co-changed once with `MToolBar.java`, with a confidence of 0.1. Given its potential relevance within the UI context where `MToolBar.java` operates, it is included in the change set.\n\n9. **QuickOpenDialog**: Co-changed once with `MToolBar.java`, with a confidence of 0.1. As with other entities, it appears in the co-change history and could potentially be impacted by changes in `MToolBar.java`.\n\nThis change set is based on both the historical co-change data and the direct references identified through static analysis, providing a comprehensive list of entities that may require synchronized modifications when changes are made to `MToolBar.java`.",

In order to help solve the CIA mission, you should first understand some necessary concepts\uff1a\n(1)entity: Entities represent source code files in CIA tasks, and all the CIA tasks under study are based on the Java language, so entities are files with the .java extension.\n(2)starting entity: The starting entity is also called salient entity, and the salient entity is the root change that causes the modification of the rest of entities in a change set, while the rest of entities are the dependency modification along with the salient one.\nYou will be presented with a starting entity and tools (functions) will be provided to access the more information of the origin system. Your task is to gradually explain which entity really need to be synchronized, based on the starting entity and the information obtained through the function-call. You have 7 chances to call the function to get more information."

Action.java\n   - Support: 5\n   - Confidence: 0.19230769230769232\n   - Rationale: While there's no information about conceptual coupling, the number of times this entity has been changed together with `SummaryData.java` indicates a moderate likelihood of requiring synchronized modifications.\n\n5. CalendarComponent.java\n   - Support: 3\n   - Confidence: 0.11538461538461539\n   - Rationale: With lower support and confidence compared to the previous entities, but still showing up frequently enough in past changes, `CalendarComponent.java` completes our change set. It may have less obvious connections to `SummaryData.java`, but the history suggests it should not be overlooked when changes occur.\n\nEach entity in the change set needs to be considered for synchronization when modifying `SummaryData.java` because they have shown a pattern of being changed together in the project's version history, and where applicable, exhibit strong conceptual relationships indicating potential shared functionality or purpose.",

SummaryPanel.java\n   - Support: 8\n   - Confidence: 0.3076923076923077\n   - Conceptual Coupling with SummaryData.java: 0.8328582\n   - Rationale: Despite having no direct call or coupling dependencies with `SummaryData.java`, `SummaryPanel.java` shares a high conceptual coupling with it, indicating they might be part of the same functional module or share similar responsibilities.\n\n3. SummaryTree.java\n   - Support: 6\n   - Confidence: 0.23076923076923078\n   - Conceptual Coupling with SummaryData.java: 0.82362086\n   - Rationale: The third most supported and confident co-change relationship, coupled with a high conceptual coupling score, suggests that `SummaryTree.java` often changes alongside `SummaryData.java` due to shared functionality or structural interdependence.\n\n4. Action.java\n   - Support: 5\n   - Confidence: 0.19230769230769232\n   - Rationale: While there's no information about conceptual coupling, the number of times this entity has been changed together with `SummaryData.java` indicates a moderate likelihood of requiring synchronized modifications.\n\n5. CalendarComponent.java\n   - Support: 3\n   - Confidence: 0.11538461538461539\n   - Rationale: With lower support and confidence compared to the previous entities, but still showing up frequently enough in past changes, `CalendarComponent.java` completes our change set. It may have less obvious connections to `SummaryData.java`, but the history suggests it should not be overlooked when changes occur.\n\nEach entity in the change set needs to be considered for synchronization when modifying `SummaryData.java` because they have shown a pattern of being changed together in the project's version history, and where applicable, exhibit strong conceptual relationships indicating potential shared functionality or purpose.",

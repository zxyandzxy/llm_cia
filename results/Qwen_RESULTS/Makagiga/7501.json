In order to help solve the CIA mission, you should first understand some necessary concepts\uff1a\n(1)entity: Entities represent source code files in CIA tasks, and all the CIA tasks under study are based on the Java language, so entities are files with the .java extension.\n(2)starting entity: The starting entity is also called salient entity, and the salient entity is the root change that causes the modification of the rest of entities in a change set, while the rest of entities are the dependency modification along with the salient one.\nYou will be presented with a starting entity and tools (functions) will be provided to access the more information of the origin system. Your task is to gradually explain which entity really need to be synchronized, based on the starting entity and the information obtained through the function-call. You have 7 chances to call the function to get more information."

Specifically, `CryptoUtils.java` invokes static methods and variables from `TK.java`, such as `fastSplit`, `checkNull`, and `EMPTY_BYTE_ARRAY`. Any modifications to these elements in `TK.java` could directly impact `CryptoUtils.java`, necessitating synchronized changes.\n\n2. **TestCryptoUtils.java**: This test class ranks second in the change set due to its high conceptual similarity with `CryptoUtils.java`. The semantic similarity probability of approximately 0.868 suggests that it's likely a test class for `CryptoUtils.java`. When `CryptoUtils.java` undergoes changes, it's crucial to update `TestCryptoUtils.java` accordingly to ensure the tests remain valid and comprehensive.\n\n3. **MPasswordField.java**: Although there are no direct coupling dependencies between `CryptoUtils.java` and `MPasswordField.java`, they have been co-changed together in the past, as indicated by the result of the `get_co_change_relationship` function.

Specifically, `CryptoUtils.java` invokes static methods and variables from `TK.java`, such as `fastSplit`, `checkNull`, and `EMPTY_BYTE_ARRAY`.

When `CryptoUtils.java` undergoes changes, it's crucial to update `TestCryptoUtils.java` accordingly to ensure the tests remain valid and comprehensive.\n\n3. **MPasswordField.java**: Although there are no direct coupling dependencies between `CryptoUtils.java` and `MPasswordField.java`, they have been co-changed together in the past, as indicated by the result of the `get_co_change_relationship` function.

Your task is to gradually explain which entity really need to be synchronized, based on the starting entity and the information obtained through the function-call.

Moreover, there are strong coupling dependencies including Return Type (RT), Method Member Variable Usage Variable (MMAUA), and Constructor Invoking (CMI).

In order to help solve the CIA mission, you should first understand some necessary concepts\uff1a\n(1)entity: Entities represent source code files in CIA tasks, and all the CIA tasks under study are based on the Java language, so entities are files with the .java extension.\n(2)starting entity: The starting entity is also called salient entity, and the salient entity is the root change that causes the modification of the rest of entities in a change set, while the rest of entities are the dependency modification along with the salient one.\nYou will be presented with a starting entity and tools (functions) will be provided to access the more information of the origin system. Your task is to gradually explain which entity really need to be synchronized, based on the starting entity and the information obtained through the function-call. You have 7 chances to call the function to get more information."

Additionally, it shares high conceptual coupling with `MCalendarPanel.java`, making it highly likely to require synchronization when changes occur.\n\n2. **DateTimeDialog**: With a support count of 5 and a confidence of 0.217, this entity is frequently changed alongside `MCalendarPanel.java`. Despite being removed from the project version, its historical co-change pattern suggests it was closely related.\n\n3. **DayButton**: Also having a support count of 5 and a confidence of 0.217, indicating a strong co-change relationship with `MCalendarPanel.java`. However, similar to `DateTimeDialog`, it has been removed from recent versions.\n\n4. **SummaryData**: It appeared in 5 instances with a confidence level of 0.217, suggesting that changes to `MCalendarPanel.java` may also affect this entity.\n\n5. **CalendarComponent**: This entity has a support count of 4 and a confidence of 0.174, implying a moderate need for synchronized changes.\n\n6. **MDateSpinner**: Like `CalendarComponent`, it has a support count of 4 and a confidence of 0.174.\n\n7. **Events**: Appeared once with a low confidence of 0.043, indicating a minimal likelihood of requiring synchronization but still noted due to past co-changes.\n\n8. **DateAction**, **MonthAction**, **Renderer**, **DayLabel**, **WeekLabel**, **SetDateTimeAction**, **TaskReader**, **SummaryTree**, **CategoryListRenderer**, **DebugOutputStream**, **GlassPainter**, **Updater**, **SessionManager**, **TaskTable**, **Input**, **MComponent**, **SetDateAction**, **AbstractTest**, **MSimpleLayout**, **ConsoleIO**, **XMLHelper**, **MainPanel**: These entities have fewer supports and lower confidence levels compared to the top-ranked ones. They are included based on their co-change history, though they are less likely to need synchronization compared to the higher-ranked entities.\n\nNote: Entities like `DateTimeDialog` and `DayButton` were historically significant but have since been removed from the project. Their inclusion here is based on their past co-change patterns rather than current relevance. The primary focus should be on `CalendarWidget` given its high co-change frequency and conceptual coupling with `MCalendarPanel.java`.",

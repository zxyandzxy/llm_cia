Your task is to gradually explain which entity really need to be synchronized, based on the starting entity and the information obtained through the function-call.

The conceptual coupling between these two files is also very strong (semantic similarity probability of approximately 0.842).

Although we did not perform detailed checks for this entity, its frequent co-occurrence suggests that it is part of the same or closely related functionality within the application.\n\n4. **Action.java**: It has a moderate number of supports (5) and a confidence level of 0.19230769230769232. Given its co-change frequency, it's reasonable to consider that `Action.java` might need synchronization with `SummaryData.java`, especially if actions are defined based on the summary data provided by the system.\n\n5. **CalendarComponent.java**: While it has fewer supports (3) compared to the above entities, it still appears in the co-change history with a confidence level of 0.11538461538461539.

The two entities share a close functional relationship within the application, even though they do not directly depend on each other through code.\n\n2. **SummaryPanel.java**: Similarly, `SummaryPanel.java` has been co-changed frequently (8 times) with `SummaryData.java`, having a confidence level of 0.3076923076923077. The conceptual coupling between these two files is also very strong (semantic similarity probability of approximately 0.842). This indicates that `SummaryPanel.java` should be reviewed and possibly updated when there are modifications to `SummaryData.java`.\n\n3. **SummaryTree.java**: This entity has been co-changed 6 times along with `SummaryData.java`, with a confidence level of 0.23076923076923078. Although we did not perform detailed checks for this entity, its frequent co-occurrence suggests that it is part of the same or closely related functionality within the application.\n\n4. **Action.java**: It has a moderate number of supports (5) and a confidence level of 0.19230769230769232. Given its co-change frequency, it's reasonable to consider that `Action.java` might need synchronization with `SummaryData.java`, especially if actions are defined based on the summary data provided by the system.\n\n5. **CalendarComponent.java**: While it has fewer supports (3) compared to the above entities, it still appears in the co-change history with a confidence level of 0.11538461538461539. This suggests some degree of logical dependency or shared functionality that warrants attention during modifications.\n\nThe elements in the Change set are sorted in descending order of the likelihood of synchronized modifications, taking into account both the co-change frequency and the strength of the conceptual coupling between `SummaryData.java` and each entity.",

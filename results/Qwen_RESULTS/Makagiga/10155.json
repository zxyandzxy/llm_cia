Additionally, based on the previous co-change analysis, entities such as `DesktopPanel.java`, `MainWindow.java`, and `NoteWidgetPlugin.java` also have a strong correlation with `Desktop.java` in terms of past modifications.\n\nTherefore, we should recommend synchronizing the following entities when changing `Desktop.java`:\n\n- `WidgetDesktopPaneUI.java` (due to direct type casting dependency)\n- `DesktopPanel.java` (high support count and confidence value in co-changes)\n- `MainWindow.java` (relatively high support count and confidence value in co-changes)\n- `NoteWidgetPlugin.java` (moderate support count and confidence value in co-changes)\n\nIf there is time for one more function call, I would suggest using the `get_conceptual_coupling` function to assess the conceptual similarity between `Desktop.java` and `DesktopPanel.java`, even though they don't have direct coupling dependencies. This could provide additional insights into why they are frequently changed together.

Additionally, based on the previous co-change analysis, entities such as `DesktopPanel.java`, `MainWindow.java`, and `NoteWidgetPlugin.java` also have a strong correlation with `Desktop.java` in terms of past modifications.\n\nTherefore, we should recommend synchronizing the following entities when changing `Desktop.java`:\n\n- `WidgetDesktopPaneUI.java` (due to direct type casting dependency)\n- `DesktopPanel.java` (high support count and confidence value in co-changes)\n- `MainWindow.java` (relatively high support count and confidence value in co-changes)\n- `NoteWidgetPlugin.java` (moderate support count and confidence value in co-changes)\n\nIf there is time for one more function call, I would suggest using the `get_conceptual_coupling` function to assess the conceptual similarity between `Desktop.java` and `DesktopPanel.java`, even though they don't have direct coupling dependencies.

This means that despite the fact that `SessionManager.java` is called within `MainWindow.java`, they do not share any explicit code-level dependencies such as inheritance, implementing interfaces, or method calls that would create a strong coupling.\n\nGiven this information, it seems that the co-change relationship between `SessionManager.java` and `MainWindow.java` could be due to higher-level architectural reasons or runtime interactions rather than static code analysis. Changes in `SessionManager.java` might necessitate changes in `MainWindow.java` because `MainWindow` uses `SessionManager` at runtime, even though there's no direct coupling in the code.\n\nSince we've explored the main entities that co-change with `SessionManager.java` and have analyzed their relationships, let's summarize our findings:\n\n- We identified several entities that frequently change alongside `SessionManager.java`.\n- Among them, `MainWindow.java` had the highest confidence level for co-change.\n- `SessionManager.java` interacts directly with `MainWindow.java` and other entities like `Tabs.java`.\n- There are no direct coupling dependencies between `SessionManager.java` and either `MainWindow.java` or `Tabs.java`.\n\nBased on these findings, if you modify `SessionManager.java`, you should consider reviewing `MainWindow.java` for potential necessary changes due to their interaction. Additionally, although there is no direct coupling, historical data suggests that `Tabs.java` might also require attention when modifying `SessionManager.java`.\n\nIf further analysis is needed, you may want to look into the specific parts of `MainWindow.java` and `SessionManager.java` where they interact, possibly by examining how `SessionManager` is used within `MainWindow`.

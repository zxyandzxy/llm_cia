This indicates that whenever `PropertiesPanel.java` was changed in the past, `PropertiesBar.java` was also frequently modified. Therefore, changes to `PropertiesPanel.java` should prompt a review of `PropertiesBar.java` to ensure consistency.\n  \n- **TreePanel.java**: This entity shares a strong conceptual coupling with `PropertiesPanel.java` (semantic similarity probability of 0.85). The high semantic similarity suggests that these two entities are likely to be conceptually related and may share similar functionalities or responsibilities within the project. Thus, changes to `PropertiesPanel.java` might necessitate corresponding changes in `TreePanel.java`.\n\nThe rest of the entities listed have lower confidence scores ranging from 0.09 to 0.18, indicating less frequent co-changes with `PropertiesPanel.java`. However, they still appear in the co-change history, which means they were modified alongside `PropertiesPanel.java` at least once.

This indicates that whenever `PropertiesPanel.java` was changed in the past, `PropertiesBar.java` was also frequently modified. Therefore, changes to `PropertiesPanel.java` should prompt a review of `PropertiesBar.java` to ensure consistency.\n  \n- **TreePanel.java**: This entity shares a strong conceptual coupling with `PropertiesPanel.java` (semantic similarity probability of 0.85). The high semantic similarity suggests that these two entities are likely to be conceptually related and may share similar functionalities or responsibilities within the project. Thus, changes to `PropertiesPanel.java` might necessitate corresponding changes in `TreePanel.java`.\n\nThe rest of the entities listed have lower confidence scores ranging from 0.09 to 0.18, indicating less frequent co-changes with `PropertiesPanel.java`.

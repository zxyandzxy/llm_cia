Additionally, the conceptual coupling score of 0.691 indicates a strong semantic similarity, suggesting that both files are likely part of related features or functionalities within the application.\n\n2. **MFileChooser.java**: Similarly to `MainWindow.java`, it shares the same number of supports (2) and confidence level (0.5). Although there was no direct coupling dependency detected, its frequent co-changes with `Size.java` suggest that these two entities might be involved in similar user interactions or workflows within the project.\n\n3. **Other Entities**: The remaining entities listed in the change set have been observed to change along with `Size.java` only once, giving them a support count of 1 and a confidence level of 0.25. While they may not show significant evidence of direct interaction or conceptual similarity, their historical co-changes indicate that they could potentially require updates when `Size.java` is modified. These entities should be reviewed during code changes to ensure that any necessary adjustments are made.\n\nThe elements in the Change set are sorted in descending order of the likelihood of synchronized modifications based on the number of supports and confidence levels obtained from the co-change relationship analysis. Entities like `MainWindow.java` and `MFileChooser.java` are prioritized due to their higher co-change frequency and stronger indicators of relatedness to `Size.java`.

Although `MFileChooser.java` also shows up frequently in co-changes, without any detected coupling or strong conceptual coupling, the reasoning behind its co-change frequency remains less clear than for `MainWindow.java`.

Additionally, the conceptual coupling score of 0.691 indicates a strong semantic similarity, suggesting that both files are likely part of related features or functionalities within the application.\n\n2. **MFileChooser.java**: Similarly to `MainWindow.java`, it shares the same number of supports (2) and confidence level (0.5). Although there was no direct coupling dependency detected, its frequent co-changes with `Size.java` suggest that these two entities might be involved in similar user interactions or workflows within the project.\n\n3. **Other Entities**: The remaining entities listed in the change set have been observed to change along with `Size.java` only once, giving them a support count of 1 and a confidence level of 0.25. While they may not show significant evidence of direct interaction or conceptual similarity, their historical co-changes indicate that they could potentially require updates when `Size.java` is modified. These entities should be reviewed during code changes to ensure that any necessary adjustments are made.\n\nThe elements in the Change set are sorted in descending order of the likelihood of synchronized modifications based on the number of supports and confidence levels obtained from the co-change relationship analysis. Entities like `MainWindow.java` and `MFileChooser.java` are prioritized due to their higher co-change frequency and stronger indicators of relatedness to `Size.java`.

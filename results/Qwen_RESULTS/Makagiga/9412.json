In order to help solve the CIA mission, you should first understand some necessary concepts\uff1a\n(1)entity: Entities represent source code files in CIA tasks, and all the CIA tasks under study are based on the Java language, so entities are files with the .java extension.\n(2)starting entity: The starting entity is also called salient entity, and the salient entity is the root change that causes the modification of the rest of entities in a change set, while the rest of entities are the dependency modification along with the salient one.\nYou will be presented with a starting entity and tools (functions) will be provided to access the more information of the origin system. Your task is to gradually explain which entity really need to be synchronized, based on the starting entity and the information obtained through the function-call. You have 7 chances to call the function to get more information."

Changes to `MGraphics2D.java` are likely to affect `MSystemTray.java`.\n\n2. **MIcon**, **UI**, **MMouseAdapter**, **OS**, **MLogger**, **TK**, **MApplication**: These entities were found through the call graph analysis, meaning they are directly used or called by `MSystemTray.java`. Any modifications to these entities could potentially impact the functionality of `MSystemTray.java`, making it necessary to consider them for synchronized changes.\n\n3. **Uninstantiable**: This entity also appeared in the call graph, indicating that `MSystemTray.java` depends on it. Although we do not have further details about its nature, it should be included in the change set due to its direct use within `MSystemTray.java`.\n\nIt's important to note that while the co-change history suggested other entities (`Vars.java`, `Reminder.java`, `TasksSettings.java`) that had been modified alongside `MSystemTray.java`, none of these exhibited any direct coupling dependencies or significant conceptual coupling.

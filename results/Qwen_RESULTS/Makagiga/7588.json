Additionally, the conceptual coupling between `CalendarWidget.java` and `CalendarWidgetPlugin` is high at approximately 0.84, indicating a strong semantic relationship.

While there is no additional information about direct interactions or coupling, its co-change history suggests that it might require synchronization when `CalendarWidget.java` changes.\n\n3. **PluginManager**: With 1 support and a confidence of 0.33, this entity also shares a co-change history with `CalendarWidget.java`. It is included in the change set due to its past association during code modifications.\n\n4. **ImportExport**: Similar to other entities with lower confidence, this entity has been changed alongside `CalendarWidget.java` once, resulting in a confidence level of 0.33. It is part of the change set as a precautionary measure based on historical data.\n\n5. **LabelMenuAction**: This entity has appeared in the co-change list with the same support and confidence as ImportExport. It should be reviewed for potential necessary modifications in tandem with `CalendarWidget.java`.\n\n6. **CalendarComponent**: Lastly, this entity also shares the same co-change frequency and confidence level as ImportExport and LabelMenuAction.

Additionally, the conceptual coupling between `CalendarWidget.java` and `CalendarWidgetPlugin` is high at approximately 0.84, indicating a strong semantic relationship. Although no direct coupling dependencies were found, this entity is likely to be affected by changes in `CalendarWidget.java`.\n\n2. **OptionsPanel**: This entity appears in the co-change list with 1 support and a confidence of 0.33. While there is no additional information about direct interactions or coupling, its co-change history suggests that it might require synchronization when `CalendarWidget.java` changes.\n\n3. **PluginManager**: With 1 support and a confidence of 0.33, this entity also shares a co-change history with `CalendarWidget.java`. It is included in the change set due to its past association during code modifications.\n\n4. **ImportExport**: Similar to other entities with lower confidence, this entity has been changed alongside `CalendarWidget.java` once, resulting in a confidence level of 0.33. It is part of the change set as a precautionary measure based on historical data.\n\n5. **LabelMenuAction**: This entity has appeared in the co-change list with the same support and confidence as ImportExport. It should be reviewed for potential necessary modifications in tandem with `CalendarWidget.java`.\n\n6. **CalendarComponent**: Lastly, this entity also shares the same co-change frequency and confidence level as ImportExport and LabelMenuAction. It is included in the change set following the co-change pattern observed in the project's version history.\n\nThe elements in the Change set are sorted in descending order of the likelihood of synchronized modifications, taking into account both the number of supports and the confidence level obtained from the co-change relationship analysis, as well as any additional evidence from conceptual coupling where applicable.",

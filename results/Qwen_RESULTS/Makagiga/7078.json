This suggests that while `VCalendarEntry` changes alongside `VCalendar.java`, it may not be directly referenced or used within `VCalendar.java`. It could be involved indirectly, for example, through inheritance or interface implementation which we have already checked and found no direct coupling dependencies.\n\nGiven the co-change relationship but lack of direct usage or coupling, we can infer that `VCalendarEntry` might be part of the same module or subsystem and its changes are often necessary to maintain consistency with changes in `VCalendar.java`.\n\nTo summarize our findings:\n- `DebugOutputStream` has been removed from the project and can be excluded.\n- `TestVCalendar` likely contains tests for `VCalendar.java` and should be synchronized.\n- `VCalendarEntry` shows a co-change pattern with `VCalendar.java` but lacks direct coupling or semantic similarity.

Additionally, it shares a high conceptual coupling (semantic similarity probability of 0.8410165), indicating that changes to `TodoEditor.java` are likely to necessitate corresponding changes in `TodoEditorCore`.\n\n2. **TaskTable**: This entity appears in the co-change history with 3 supports and a confidence level of 0.15. Although no direct coupling dependencies were found, its frequent appearance alongside `TodoEditor.java` suggests that they might be functionally related, requiring synchronized changes.\n\n3. **TodoEditorPlugin**: It has been co-changed with `TodoEditor.java` twice, giving it a confidence score of 0.1. As plugins often extend or modify editor functionality, changes here could have implications for `TodoEditor.java`.\n\n4. **ColumnManager**: With 2 supports and a confidence of 0.1, it is called by `TodoEditor.java` and has a functional relationship, which may require synchronization when there are interface or interaction changes.\n\n5. **SearchBar**: Also appearing twice with a confidence of 0.1, this entity could be part of the UI components or search functionalities used within the editor, potentially needing updates if related features change.\n\n6. **TextEditor**: Similarly, with 2 supports and a confidence of 0.1, this entity might share common text editing functionalities or components with `TodoEditor.java`, making it a candidate for synchronized changes.\n\n7. **MTable, SortAction, SummaryEditor, SelectAllAction, UnselectAll, AbstractSettings, DeleteCompletedAction, Vars, PriorityEditor, Links, TaskStateMenu, TaskButton**: These entities each appear once in the co-change history with low confidence scores.

Additionally, it shares a high conceptual coupling (semantic similarity probability of 0.8410165), indicating that changes to `TodoEditor.java` are likely to necessitate corresponding changes in `TodoEditorCore`.\n\n2. **TaskTable**: This entity appears in the co-change history with 3 supports and a confidence level of 0.15.

As plugins often extend or modify editor functionality, changes here could have implications for `TodoEditor.java`.\n\n4. **ColumnManager**: With 2 supports and a confidence of 0.1, it is called by `TodoEditor.java` and has a functional relationship, which may require synchronization when there are interface or interaction changes.\n\n5. **SearchBar**: Also appearing twice with a confidence of 0.1, this entity could be part of the UI components or search functionalities used within the editor, potentially needing updates if related features change.\n\n6. **TextEditor**: Similarly, with 2 supports and a confidence of 0.1, this entity might share common text editing functionalities or components with `TodoEditor.java`, making it a candidate for synchronized changes.\n\n7. **MTable, SortAction, SummaryEditor, SelectAllAction, UnselectAll, AbstractSettings, DeleteCompletedAction, Vars, PriorityEditor, Links, TaskStateMenu, TaskButton**: These entities each appear once in the co-change history with low confidence scores.

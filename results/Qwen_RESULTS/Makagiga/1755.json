Although no direct structural dependencies were found, the conceptual relationships and historical co-changes suggest potential ripple effects that could impact these entities.",

Furthermore, the conceptual coupling between `Sorter.java` and `Filter` is very high (approximately 0.855), suggesting that they share similar functionality or responsibilities. Therefore, it's highly likely that changes in `Sorter.java` will require corresponding modifications in `Filter`.\n\n- **TodoEditorCore**: Similarly, `TodoEditorCore` also shows a strong co-change relationship with `Sorter.java` (`support`: 1, `confidence`: 1.0) and a significant conceptual coupling (approximately 0.832). This implies that these two entities are conceptually related and may be affected by each other's changes. As a result, when modifying `Sorter.java`, one should consider synchronized changes in `TodoEditorCore` to maintain consistency and avoid potential issues.\n\nThe elements in the Change set are sorted in descending order of the likelihood of synchronized modifications based on the confidence levels and semantic similarity probabilities provided by our analysis functions.

Although no direct structural dependencies were found, the conceptual relationships and historical co-changes suggest potential ripple effects that could impact these entities.",

Furthermore, the conceptual coupling between `Sorter.java` and `Filter` is very high (approximately 0.855), suggesting that they share similar functionality or responsibilities.

This implies that these two entities are conceptually related and may be affected by each other's changes.

Moreover, there is a strong conceptual coupling probability of approximately 0.84 between `MNotification.java` and `Reminder`, which indicates they share significant semantic similarities that necessitate coordinated changes.\n\n2. **MWindow**: With a support count of 3 and a confidence of 0.16, this entity has been frequently modified alongside `MNotification.java`.\n\n3. **OS**: It co-changed 2 times with `MNotification.java`, providing a moderate confidence level of 0.11.

They might be indirectly affected by changes in `MNotification.java` or could influence the behavior of `MNotification.java` through less direct dependencies.\n\nIt's important to note that while entities such as `Mods` were found to be directly called by `MNotification.java`, no coupling dependencies were identified between them, and therefore they are not included in the change set prioritized for synchronization.\n\nIn conclusion, the primary focus should be on synchronizing changes with `Reminder` due to its high confidence score and strong conceptual coupling with `MNotification.java`.

In order to help solve the CIA mission, you should first understand some necessary concepts\uff1a\n(1)entity: Entities represent source code files in CIA tasks, and all the CIA tasks under study are based on the Java language, so entities are files with the .java extension.\n(2)starting entity: The starting entity is also called salient entity, and the salient entity is the root change that causes the modification of the rest of entities in a change set, while the rest of entities are the dependency modification along with the salient one.\nYou will be presented with a starting entity and tools (functions) will be provided to access the more information of the origin system. Your task is to gradually explain which entity really need to be synchronized, based on the starting entity and the information obtained through the function-call. You have 7 chances to call the function to get more information."

Although there is no direct coupling, its high frequency of co-change suggests it may be part of the same feature or module, necessitating synchronized modifications to ensure consistency across related functionalities.\n\n- `SummaryTree.java`: Co-changed 6 times with `SummaryData.java` and having a confidence level of 0.231, this entity also appears to be closely associated within the application's architecture. It might represent another aspect of the summary-related features that need alignment when `SummaryData.java` undergoes changes.\n\n- `Action.java`: With a co-change count of 5 and a confidence level of 0.192, `Action.java` frequently changes together with `SummaryData.java`. Given the name, it is plausible that actions defined in this file interact with or affect the data managed by `SummaryData.java`, thus requiring concurrent updates.\n\n- `CalendarComponent.java`: This entity shows a lower but still notable co-change frequency of 3 and a confidence level of 0.115.

However, it has been changed alongside `MTreeItem.java` in the past, suggesting a potential indirect dependency or shared functionality requiring further investigation.\n\n3. **Tree** - Support: 1, Confidence: 0.2\n   Listed as a co-changed entity but requires more context to determine its relevance.

It might share data structures or logic related to `MTreeItem.java`.\n\n6. **Node.java** - Support: 1, Confidence: 0.2\n   Could be part of the underlying data structure used by `MTreeItem.java`, thus requiring synchronization when changes occur.\n\n7. **Renderer.java** - Support: 1, Confidence: 0.2\n   Likely involved in the rendering process, which might impact how `MTreeItem.java` displays information or interacts with users.\n\n8. **MHighlighter.java** - Support: 1, Confidence: 0.2\n   Possibly connected to highlighting features within the UI that involve `MTreeItem.java`.\n\n9. **StaticFocusHandler.java** - Support: 1, Confidence: 0.2\n   Might manage focus events for `MTreeItem.java` or other UI components, necessitating review if `MTreeItem.java` is modified.\n\nGiven the limited number of function calls, we prioritized checking entities with potentially stronger technical or conceptual dependencies.

In order to help solve the CIA mission, you should first understand some necessary concepts\uff1a\n(1)entity: Entities represent source code files in CIA tasks, and all the CIA tasks under study are based on the Java language, so entities are files with the .java extension.\n(2)starting entity: The starting entity is also called salient entity, and the salient entity is the root change that causes the modification of the rest of entities in a change set, while the rest of entities are the dependency modification along with the salient one.\nYou will be presented with a starting entity and tools (functions) will be provided to access the more information of the origin system. Your task is to gradually explain which entity really need to be synchronized, based on the starting entity and the information obtained through the function-call. You have 7 chances to call the function to get more information."

With 6 supports and a confidence level of approximately 0.231, it's highly probable that changes in `SummaryData.java` will impact `SummaryTree.java`, which is responsible for displaying hierarchical structures related to summary data.\n\n- **Action.java**: This entity shows up in the co-change results with 5 supports and a confidence level of approximately 0.192. While there is no direct evidence from the call graph or coupling dependencies, its frequent appearance alongside `SummaryData.java` during past modifications implies a potential indirect dependency or shared context that necessitates synchronization.\n\n- **CalendarComponent.java**: Having 3 supports and a confidence level of approximately 0.115, this entity may also need to be considered for synchronization. Despite not having a direct call or coupling dependency, its presence in the co-change results hints at a possible connection through other parts of the application.\n\nFull Change Set ordered by supports and confidence (in descending order):\n```json\n[\n  [\"SummaryPanel\", \"8\", \"0.3076923076923077\"],\n  [\"Reminder\", \"8\", \"0.3076923076923077\"],\n  [\"SummaryTree\", \"6\", \"0.23076923076923078\"],\n  [\"Action\", \"5\", \"0.19230769230769232\"],\n  [\"CalendarComponent\", \"3\", \"0.11538461538461539\"],\n  [\"ChartPainter\", \"1\", \"0.038461538461538464\"],\n  [\"MText\", \"1\", \"0.038461538461538464\"],\n  [\"EditorQuickFind\", \"1\", \"0.038461538461538464\"],\n  [\"DataVisitor\", \"1\", \"0.038461538461538464\"],\n  [\"PrintDialog\", \"1\", \"0.038461538461538464\"],\n  [\"Group\", \"1\", \"0.038461538461538464\"],\n  [\"GroupTree\", \"1\", \"0.038461538461538464\"],\n  [\"FileCache\", \"1\", \"0.038461538461538464\"],\n  [\"ImageEditor\", \"1\", \"0.038461538461538464\"],\n  [\"SimpleButtonUI\", \"1\", \"0.038461538461538464\"],\n  [\"GhostFrame\", \"1\", \"0.038461538461538464\"],\n  [\"HiddenCommentView\", \"1\", \"0.038461538461538464\"],\n  [\"MSmallButton\", \"1\", \"0.038461538461538464\"],\n  [\"HTMLViewFactory\", \"1\", \"0.038461538461538464\"],\n  [\"EditorCrypto\", \"1\", \"0.038461538461538464\"],\n  [\"DateAction\", \"1\", \"0.038461538461538464\"],\n  [\"HiddenFormView\", \"1\", \"0.038461538461538464\"],\n  [\"Renderer\", \"1\", \"0.038461538461538464\"],\n  [\"PrintAction\", \"1\", \"0.038461538461538464\"],\n  [\"Tracker\", \"1\", \"0.038461538461538464\"],\n  [\"StatsPanel\", \"2\", \"0.07692307692307693\"],\n  [\"Chart\", \"1\", \"0.038461538461538464\"],\n  [\"TaskComparator\", \"1\", \"0.038461538461538464\"],\n  [\"NodeComparator\", \"1\", \"0.038461538461538464\"],\n  [\"TaskList\", \"1\", \"0.038461538461538464\"],\n  [\"Sorter\", \"1\", \"0.038461538461538464\"],\n  [\"MTip\", \"1\", \"0.038461538461538464\"],\n  [\"PropertiesBar\", \"1\", \"0.038461538461538464\"],\n  [\"Index\", \"2\", \"0.07692307692307693\"],\n  [\"TreeFS\", \"1\", \"0.038461538461538464\"],\n  [\"LazyTreeFSHolder\", \"1\", \"0.038461538461538464\"],\n  [\"LazySummaryDataHolder\", \"1\", \"0.038461538461538464\"],\n  [\"LazyIndexHolder\", \"1\", \"0.038461538461538464\"],\n  [\"ReferenceCount\", \"1\", \"0.038461538461538464\"],\n  [\"ShowTaskAction\", \"1\", \"0.038461538461538464\"],\n  [\"Submenu\", \"2\", \"0.07692307692307693\"],\n  [\"TagsMenu\", \"2\", \"0.07692307692307693\"],\n  [\"MainWindow\", \"1\", \"0.038461538461538464\"],\n  [\"Button\", \"1\", \"0.038461538461538464\"],\n  [\"MetaInfoMenu\", \"1\", \"0.038461538461538464\"],\n  [\"PickerColorChooserPanel\", \"1\", \"0.038461538461538464\"],\n  [\"MFontChooser\", \"1\", \"0.038461538461538464\"],\n  [\"SummaryCategory\", \"2\", \"0.07692307692307693\"],\n  [\"TodoWidget\", \"1\", \"0.038461538461538464\"],\n  [\"ByName\", \"1\", \"0.038461538461538464\"],\n  [\"MetaInfoComparator\", \"1\", \"0.038461538461538464\"],\n  [\"MetaInfoNodeComparator\", \"1\", \"0.038461538461538464\"],\n  [\"Reload\", \"1\", \"0.038461538461538464\"],\n  [\"CategoryManager\", \"1\", \"0.038461538461538464\"],\n  [\"CategoryList\", \"1\", \"0.038461538461538464\"],\n  [\"Day\", \"1\", \"0.038461538461538464\"],\n  [\"Vars\", \"1\", \"0.038461538461538464\"],\n  [\"TasksSettings\", \"1\", \"0.038461538461538464\"]\n]\n```\nThis detailed change set provides a comprehensive view of the entities that might need to be synchronized when modifying `SummaryData.java`.

This suggests that changes in `SummaryData.java` often require corresponding changes in `SummaryPanel.java` to maintain consistency in how data is summarized and displayed.\n  \n- **Reminder.java**: Similarly to `SummaryPanel.java`, this entity has a strong conceptual relationship with `SummaryData.java` (0.855). The co-change pattern indicates that these two entities are likely to be modified together due to their semantic similarity and shared functionality within the application.\n\n- **SummaryTree.java**: It appears in both the co-change results and the call graph from `SummaryData.java`. With 6 supports and a confidence level of approximately 0.231, it's highly probable that changes in `SummaryData.java` will impact `SummaryTree.java`, which is responsible for displaying hierarchical structures related to summary data.\n\n- **Action.java**: This entity shows up in the co-change results with 5 supports and a confidence level of approximately 0.192. While there is no direct evidence from the call graph or coupling dependencies, its frequent appearance alongside `SummaryData.java` during past modifications implies a potential indirect dependency or shared context that necessitates synchronization.\n\n- **CalendarComponent.java**: Having 3 supports and a confidence level of approximately 0.115, this entity may also need to be considered for synchronization. Despite not having a direct call or coupling dependency, its presence in the co-change results hints at a possible connection through other parts of the application.\n\nFull Change Set ordered by supports and confidence (in descending order):\n```json\n[\n  [\"SummaryPanel\", \"8\", \"0.3076923076923077\"],\n  [\"Reminder\", \"8\", \"0.3076923076923077\"],\n  [\"SummaryTree\", \"6\", \"0.23076923076923078\"],\n  [\"Action\", \"5\", \"0.19230769230769232\"],\n  [\"CalendarComponent\", \"3\", \"0.11538461538461539\"],\n  [\"ChartPainter\", \"1\", \"0.038461538461538464\"],\n  [\"MText\", \"1\", \"0.038461538461538464\"],\n  [\"EditorQuickFind\", \"1\", \"0.038461538461538464\"],\n  [\"DataVisitor\", \"1\", \"0.038461538461538464\"],\n  [\"PrintDialog\", \"1\", \"0.038461538461538464\"],\n  [\"Group\", \"1\", \"0.038461538461538464\"],\n  [\"GroupTree\", \"1\", \"0.038461538461538464\"],\n  [\"FileCache\", \"1\", \"0.038461538461538464\"],\n  [\"ImageEditor\", \"1\", \"0.038461538461538464\"],\n  [\"SimpleButtonUI\", \"1\", \"0.038461538461538464\"],\n  [\"GhostFrame\", \"1\", \"0.038461538461538464\"],\n  [\"HiddenCommentView\", \"1\", \"0.038461538461538464\"],\n  [\"MSmallButton\", \"1\", \"0.038461538461538464\"],\n  [\"HTMLViewFactory\", \"1\", \"0.038461538461538464\"],\n  [\"EditorCrypto\", \"1\", \"0.038461538461538464\"],\n  [\"DateAction\", \"1\", \"0.038461538461538464\"],\n  [\"HiddenFormView\", \"1\", \"0.038461538461538464\"],\n  [\"Renderer\", \"1\", \"0.038461538461538464\"],\n  [\"PrintAction\", \"1\", \"0.038461538461538464\"],\n  [\"Tracker\", \"1\", \"0.038461538461538464\"],\n  [\"StatsPanel\", \"2\", \"0.07692307692307693\"],\n  [\"Chart\", \"1\", \"0.038461538461538464\"],\n  [\"TaskComparator\", \"1\", \"0.038461538461538464\"],\n  [\"NodeComparator\", \"1\", \"0.038461538461538464\"],\n  [\"TaskList\", \"1\", \"0.038461538461538464\"],\n  [\"Sorter\", \"1\", \"0.038461538461538464\"],\n  [\"MTip\", \"1\", \"0.038461538461538464\"],\n  [\"PropertiesBar\", \"1\", \"0.038461538461538464\"],\n  [\"Index\", \"2\", \"0.07692307692307693\"],\n  [\"TreeFS\", \"1\", \"0.038461538461538464\"],\n  [\"LazyTreeFSHolder\", \"1\", \"0.038461538461538464\"],\n  [\"LazySummaryDataHolder\", \"1\", \"0.038461538461538464\"],\n  [\"LazyIndexHolder\", \"1\", \"0.038461538461538464\"],\n  [\"ReferenceCount\", \"1\", \"0.038461538461538464\"],\n  [\"ShowTaskAction\", \"1\", \"0.038461538461538464\"],\n  [\"Submenu\", \"2\", \"0.07692307692307693\"],\n  [\"TagsMenu\", \"2\", \"0.07692307692307693\"],\n  [\"MainWindow\", \"1\", \"0.038461538461538464\"],\n  [\"Button\", \"1\", \"0.038461538461538464\"],\n  [\"MetaInfoMenu\", \"1\", \"0.038461538461538464\"],\n  [\"PickerColorChooserPanel\", \"1\", \"0.038461538461538464\"],\n  [\"MFontChooser\", \"1\", \"0.038461538461538464\"],\n  [\"SummaryCategory\", \"2\", \"0.07692307692307693\"],\n  [\"TodoWidget\", \"1\", \"0.038461538461538464\"],\n  [\"ByName\", \"1\", \"0.038461538461538464\"],\n  [\"MetaInfoComparator\", \"1\", \"0.038461538461538464\"],\n  [\"MetaInfoNodeComparator\", \"1\", \"0.038461538461538464\"],\n  [\"Reload\", \"1\", \"0.038461538461538464\"],\n  [\"CategoryManager\", \"1\", \"0.038461538461538464\"],\n  [\"CategoryList\", \"1\", \"0.038461538461538464\"],\n  [\"Day\", \"1\", \"0.038461538461538464\"],\n  [\"Vars\", \"1\", \"0.038461538461538464\"],\n  [\"TasksSettings\", \"1\", \"0.038461538461538464\"]\n]\n```\nThis detailed change set provides a comprehensive view of the entities that might need to be synchronized when modifying `SummaryData.java`.

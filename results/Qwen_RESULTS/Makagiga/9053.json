Furthermore, the conceptual coupling score of around 0.8675 indicates strong semantic similarity, suggesting that changes to `MTextField.java` often require corresponding changes in `MTextFieldPanel`.\n\n2. **SearchBar**: This entity has a support count of 2 and a confidence of approximately 0.286. Despite having lower co-change frequency than `MTextFieldPanel`, its high conceptual coupling score (around 0.8648) implies that it is semantically closely related to `MTextField.java`, making it likely that changes will need to be synchronized.\n\n3. **MTextFieldBeanInfo**: It has a support count of 2 and a confidence of approximately 0.286. While it shares the same co-change frequency as `SearchBar`, the context of BeanInfo typically relates to property editing or display, which could be indirectly connected with `MTextField.java`.\n\n4. **ConsoleCommandLine**, **TodoEditorCore**, **InternetSearchPanel**, **StaticHandler**, **ComponentBeanInfo**, **MStringBuilder**, **Armor**, **TextFieldExtensions**, **EditorQuickFind**, **TaskPanel**, **AbstractSpinner**, **MPasswordField**, **MComboBox**, **MFormattedTextField**, **Links**, **InternetSearch**, **TextComponentValidator**, **ValidatorSupport**, **TextHighligther**, **Console**, **MTableFilterPanel**, **QuickOpenDialog**, **MSearchPanel**: These entities have been included in the change set due to their historical co-change relationships with `MTextField.java`, albeit with a lower support count of 1 and confidence ranging from 0.143. While their conceptual coupling was not specifically analyzed, their past co-changes indicate they may be impacted by changes to `MTextField.java`.\n\nPlease note that while these entities are ordered by their likelihood of requiring synchronized changes, the direct usage analysis (`get_call_graph`) revealed that `MDocumentAdapter`, `UI`, `StyleSupport`, and `TK` are directly used by `MTextField.java`. Therefore, any changes within `MTextField.java` that affect its interaction with these entities should also be reviewed for potential modifications, regardless of their position in the list.

Your task is to gradually explain which entity really need to be synchronized, based on the starting entity and the information obtained through the function-call. You have 7 chances to call the function to get more information."

Moreover, it has a high conceptual coupling score (0.863), indicating that changes in `Console.java` are very likely to necessitate corresponding changes in `ScriptCommand.java`.\n- **ConsoleIO**: This entity is closely related to `Console.java`, as indicated by the number of supports and confidence. It is probable that modifications to the console's input/output functionalities will impact this entity.\n- **HistoryCommand**: Similar to `ConsoleIO`, this entity also shares a strong co-change relationship with `Console.java`. Given its function, which presumably involves managing command history within the console, it is highly likely that any change affecting command handling could require updates here as well.\n- **ConsoleCommand**: Like `HistoryCommand`, this entity is involved with commands executed within the console environment. The significant co-change frequency suggests that changes to how commands are processed or represented in the console could affect this entity.\n- **ConsoleTab**: With fewer supports but still notable co-change occurrences, `ConsoleTab` likely represents an interface element or feature dependent on the console's state or functionality. Thus, it should be considered for synchronization when making changes to `Console.java`.\n- **AutoCompletion**: Although having lower supports and confidence, this entity appeared in both co-change and call graph results, suggesting it has direct interaction with `Console.java`. Therefore, it is reasonable to include it in the list of entities that might need synchronized changes.\n- **MLogger**: This logging-related class was identified through co-change analysis.

Moreover, it has a high conceptual coupling score (0.863), indicating that changes in `Console.java` are very likely to necessitate corresponding changes in `ScriptCommand.java`.\n- **ConsoleIO**: This entity is closely related to `Console.java`, as indicated by the number of supports and confidence. It is probable that modifications to the console's input/output functionalities will impact this entity.\n- **HistoryCommand**: Similar to `ConsoleIO`, this entity also shares a strong co-change relationship with `Console.java`. Given its function, which presumably involves managing command history within the console, it is highly likely that any change affecting command handling could require updates here as well.\n- **ConsoleCommand**: Like `HistoryCommand`, this entity is involved with commands executed within the console environment. The significant co-change frequency suggests that changes to how commands are processed or represented in the console could affect this entity.\n- **ConsoleTab**: With fewer supports but still notable co-change occurrences, `ConsoleTab` likely represents an interface element or feature dependent on the console's state or functionality. Thus, it should be considered for synchronization when making changes to `Console.java`.\n- **AutoCompletion**: Although having lower supports and confidence, this entity appeared in both co-change and call graph results, suggesting it has direct interaction with `Console.java`. Therefore, it is reasonable to include it in the list of entities that might need synchronized changes.\n- **MLogger**: This logging-related class was identified through co-change analysis.

The lack of direct coupling could imply that they are part of the same feature set or module within the application.\n\nSince we have used up our chances to call functions, let's summarize our findings:\n\n- **Synchronize with high priority:** `ProxyModel` (due to 100% confidence in co-change).\n- **Suggested for synchronization:** `ProxyPanel` (with a confidence of approximately 67% in co-change).\n- **Consider on a case-by-case basis:** `Main` and `MUndoManager` (both with lower confidence levels in co-change).\n\nAdditionally, `TK` should also be considered due to its direct usage by `ProxyInfo.java`.\n\nIf further investigation is needed, one could manually inspect the source code of these entities or apply more sophisticated semantic analysis techniques.

This strong correlation suggests that these two entities are closely related, likely part of the same functional module or feature within the project. Therefore, it is highly recommended to synchronize changes between them.\n\n- **ProxyPanel**: With a confidence level of approximately 67%, this entity is also frequently modified alongside `ProxyInfo.java`. Although there are no direct coupling dependencies found, the repeated co-changes indicate a high likelihood of shared functionality or interaction. It's advisable to include `ProxyPanel` in synchronized modifications due to its historical pattern of being updated together with `ProxyInfo.java`.\n\n- **MUndoManager**: This entity appeared once during the co-change analysis of `ProxyInfo.java`, resulting in a lower confidence level of about 33%. While the link may not be as strong as with `ProxyModel` or `ProxyPanel`, it still shares some connection. The lack of direct coupling dependencies might suggest an indirect relationship or a less frequent but important interaction. Given the available information, it should be considered for synchronization on a case-by-case basis.\n\n- **Main**: Similar to `MUndoManager`, `Main` has a confidence level of around 33% based on the version history. Its appearance in the co-change results hints at a potential relationship with `ProxyInfo.java`, even though no direct coupling dependencies were detected. Since `Main` could represent a significant entry point or core component of the application, any changes here might have widespread effects. Therefore, it's prudent to review and possibly synchronize `Main` when updating `ProxyInfo.java`.\n\n- **TK**: This entity was directly referenced by `ProxyInfo.java` according to the call graph analysis. Although it did not appear in the co-change results, the fact that `ProxyInfo.java` uses or calls `TK` implies that changes in `ProxyInfo.java` could impact how `TK` functions or vice versa. As such, it is necessary to ensure that `TK` is examined and potentially synchronized to maintain consistency and avoid runtime issues.\n\nThe elements in the Change set are sorted in descending order of the likelihood of synchronized modifications, taking into account both the co-change confidence levels and the direct usage relationships.",

The lack of direct coupling could imply that they are part of the same feature set or module within the application.\n\nSince we have used up our chances to call functions, let's summarize our findings:\n\n- **Synchronize with high priority:** `ProxyModel` (due to 100% confidence in co-change).\n- **Suggested for synchronization:** `ProxyPanel` (with a confidence of approximately 67% in co-change).\n- **Consider on a case-by-case basis:** `Main` and `MUndoManager` (both with lower confidence levels in co-change).\n\nAdditionally, `TK` should also be considered due to its direct usage by `ProxyInfo.java`.\n\nIf further investigation is needed, one could manually inspect the source code of these entities or apply more sophisticated semantic analysis techniques.

This strong correlation suggests that these two entities are closely related, likely part of the same functional module or feature within the project. Therefore, it is highly recommended to synchronize changes between them.\n\n- **ProxyPanel**: With a confidence level of approximately 67%, this entity is also frequently modified alongside `ProxyInfo.java`. Although there are no direct coupling dependencies found, the repeated co-changes indicate a high likelihood of shared functionality or interaction. It's advisable to include `ProxyPanel` in synchronized modifications due to its historical pattern of being updated together with `ProxyInfo.java`.\n\n- **MUndoManager**: This entity appeared once during the co-change analysis of `ProxyInfo.java`, resulting in a lower confidence level of about 33%. While the link may not be as strong as with `ProxyModel` or `ProxyPanel`, it still shares some connection. The lack of direct coupling dependencies might suggest an indirect relationship or a less frequent but important interaction. Given the available information, it should be considered for synchronization on a case-by-case basis.\n\n- **Main**: Similar to `MUndoManager`, `Main` has a confidence level of around 33% based on the version history. Its appearance in the co-change results hints at a potential relationship with `ProxyInfo.java`, even though no direct coupling dependencies were detected. Since `Main` could represent a significant entry point or core component of the application, any changes here might have widespread effects. Therefore, it's prudent to review and possibly synchronize `Main` when updating `ProxyInfo.java`.\n\n- **TK**: This entity was directly referenced by `ProxyInfo.java` according to the call graph analysis. Although it did not appear in the co-change results, the fact that `ProxyInfo.java` uses or calls `TK` implies that changes in `ProxyInfo.java` could impact how `TK` functions or vice versa. As such, it is necessary to ensure that `TK` is examined and potentially synchronized to maintain consistency and avoid runtime issues.\n\nThe elements in the Change set are sorted in descending order of the likelihood of synchronized modifications, taking into account both the co-change confidence levels and the direct usage relationships.",

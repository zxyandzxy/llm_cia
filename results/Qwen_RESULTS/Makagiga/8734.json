In order to help solve the CIA mission, you should first understand some necessary concepts\uff1a\n(1)entity: Entities represent source code files in CIA tasks, and all the CIA tasks under study are based on the Java language, so entities are files with the .java extension.\n(2)starting entity: The starting entity is also called salient entity, and the salient entity is the root change that causes the modification of the rest of entities in a change set, while the rest of entities are the dependency modification along with the salient one.\nYou will be presented with a starting entity and tools (functions) will be provided to access the more information of the origin system. Your task is to gradually explain which entity really need to be synchronized, based on the starting entity and the information obtained through the function-call.

Changes to `WidgetInternalFrame` are likely to impact `MAction`, given their close functional connection within the application.\n  \n- **MActionInfo**: Although no specific evidence was found regarding its relationship with `WidgetInternalFrame.java`, it's often used alongside `MAction`, suggesting that changes affecting `MAction` might also require adjustments in `MActionInfo`.\n\n- **WidgetDesktopIconUI**: This entity is directly called by `WidgetInternalFrame.java`, indicating a potential need for synchronized changes if there are modifications to the internal frame's behavior or appearance.\n\n- **UI**: Similar to `WidgetDesktopIconUI`, this class may have a dependency on the interface components related to `WidgetInternalFrame.java`.\n\n- **MApplication**: As an overarching application context, changes in UI components like `WidgetInternalFrame` could affect how the application manages its state or interacts with other components.\n\n- **MMessage**: If messages are displayed or managed through `WidgetInternalFrame`, then any change in the internal frame could necessitate corresponding changes here.\n\n- **Focusable**: Since focus management can be tightly coupled with UI components, changes in `WidgetInternalFrame` might influence the behavior of focus-related classes.\n\n- **WidgetInternalFrameUI**: Despite the lack of explicit coupling dependencies, the name suggests a close relationship with `WidgetInternalFrame.java`, so it should still be considered for potential synchronized changes.\n\n- **MMenu**: Menus often interact with internal frames, and changes to one might imply necessary changes in the other.\n\n- **Config**: Configuration settings could be impacted by changes in UI components, particularly if they relate to customization or preferences within `WidgetInternalFrame`.\n\n- **InvokedFromConstructor**: This appears to be more of a utility or marker type; without further information, it's lower priority but still worth considering due to possible constructor interactions.\n\n- **MIcon**: Icons associated with internal frames may need updates if there are changes in the way frames are displayed or interacted with.\n\n- **PluginInfo**: If plugins extend or modify the functionality of internal frames, changes in `WidgetInternalFrame` might require updates to plugin metadata.\n\n- **TK**: Without additional context, this is ranked last but should not be completely dismissed if it has a role in UI construction or manipulation.\n\nThe elements in the Change set are sorted in descending order of the likelihood of synchronized modifications based on the analysis provided above.

Changes to `WidgetInternalFrame` are likely to impact `MAction`, given their close functional connection within the application.\n  \n- **MActionInfo**: Although no specific evidence was found regarding its relationship with `WidgetInternalFrame.java`, it's often used alongside `MAction`, suggesting that changes affecting `MAction` might also require adjustments in `MActionInfo`.\n\n- **WidgetDesktopIconUI**: This entity is directly called by `WidgetInternalFrame.java`, indicating a potential need for synchronized changes if there are modifications to the internal frame's behavior or appearance.\n\n- **UI**: Similar to `WidgetDesktopIconUI`, this class may have a dependency on the interface components related to `WidgetInternalFrame.java`.\n\n- **MApplication**: As an overarching application context, changes in UI components like `WidgetInternalFrame` could affect how the application manages its state or interacts with other components.\n\n- **MMessage**: If messages are displayed or managed through `WidgetInternalFrame`, then any change in the internal frame could necessitate corresponding changes here.\n\n- **Focusable**: Since focus management can be tightly coupled with UI components, changes in `WidgetInternalFrame` might influence the behavior of focus-related classes.\n\n- **WidgetInternalFrameUI**: Despite the lack of explicit coupling dependencies, the name suggests a close relationship with `WidgetInternalFrame.java`, so it should still be considered for potential synchronized changes.\n\n- **MMenu**: Menus often interact with internal frames, and changes to one might imply necessary changes in the other.\n\n- **Config**: Configuration settings could be impacted by changes in UI components, particularly if they relate to customization or preferences within `WidgetInternalFrame`.\n\n- **InvokedFromConstructor**: This appears to be more of a utility or marker type; without further information, it's lower priority but still worth considering due to possible constructor interactions.\n\n- **MIcon**: Icons associated with internal frames may need updates if there are changes in the way frames are displayed or interacted with.\n\n- **PluginInfo**: If plugins extend or modify the functionality of internal frames, changes in `WidgetInternalFrame` might require updates to plugin metadata.\n\n- **TK**: Without additional context, this is ranked last but should not be completely dismissed if it has a role in UI construction or manipulation.\n\nThe elements in the Change set are sorted in descending order of the likelihood of synchronized modifications based on the analysis provided above.

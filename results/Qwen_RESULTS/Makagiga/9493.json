In order to help solve the CIA mission, you should first understand some necessary concepts\uff1a\n(1)entity: Entities represent source code files in CIA tasks, and all the CIA tasks under study are based on the Java language, so entities are files with the .java extension.\n(2)starting entity: The starting entity is also called salient entity, and the salient entity is the root change that causes the modification of the rest of entities in a change set, while the rest of entities are the dependency modification along with the salient one.\nYou will be presented with a starting entity and tools (functions) will be provided to access the more information of the origin system. Your task is to gradually explain which entity really need to be synchronized, based on the starting entity and the information obtained through the function-call. You have 7 chances to call the function to get more information."

Moreover, it has a strong conceptual coupling score with `MNotification.java` (0.831), indicating that changes in `MNotification.java` are likely to impact `Reminder.java`.\n- **MWindow**: With a support count of 3 and a confidence level of 0.158, this entity also has a significant co-change relationship with `MNotification.java`. Additionally, its conceptual coupling score (0.819) is quite high, suggesting that modifications in `MNotification.java` should be synchronized with `MWindow.java`.\n- **Action, FeedThread, Message, WindowDragAdapter, MFrame**: These entities have a support count of 2 and a confidence level of 0.105. While they don't show direct coupling dependencies or as high conceptual coupling scores as `Reminder` or `MWindow`, their frequent co-changes with `MNotification.java` suggest potential indirect dependencies or related functionalities.\n- **OS, MWizard, ScriptIDE, TaskComponent, AlarmManager, TaskList, MSettingsDialog, MDateTimePanel, MPainter, MProgressBar, MURLButton, MSmallButton, MToolBar, DefaultIconLoader, MAuthenticator, MApplication, MMenuAdapter, MActionInfo, MColor, MLogger, Config, Presentation, MComponent, Renderer, PriorityRenderer, DoneComponent, CompleteRenderer, ShowHidePropertiesBarAction, SummaryPanel, ControlPanel, PropertiesPanel, NewPasswordDialog, TasksSettings, ConfigureAction, AbstractItem, DownloadInfo, Archive, EncryptDialog, Enclosure, DateTimeEditor, MAbout, MArrayList, Kiosk, UI, InvokedFromConstructor, MMouseAdapter, MTimeline, MAction, MIcon, TimelinePropertyBuilder, Mods**: These entities have lower support counts and confidence levels. They are included in the change set due to their co-change relationships with `MNotification.java`, but the likelihood of needing synchronized changes decreases progressively down the list.\n\nThe elements in the Change set are sorted in descending order of the likelihood of synchronized modifications based on support count, confidence level, and conceptual coupling scores where applicable. The top two entities (`Reminder` and `MWindow`) are most likely to need synchronization with `MNotification.java`, followed by others with decreasing priority.",

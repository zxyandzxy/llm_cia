This means that every time `PageChecker.java` was changed in the project's version history, `DefaultPageChecker.java` was also changed. Furthermore, the conceptual coupling between these two entities is quite high with a semantic similarity probability of `0.8358329`. Although no direct coupling dependencies were found, the strong co-change pattern and conceptual relatedness indicate that changes to `PageChecker.java` very likely necessitate changes to `DefaultPageChecker.java`.\n\n2. **MMainWindow.java**: Similarly, `MMainWindow.java` has a co-change relationship with `PageChecker.java`, showing a support count of 1 and a confidence of 1.0. The conceptual coupling between `PageChecker.java` and `MMainWindow.java` also indicates a significant semantic similarity with a probability of `0.7990099`. While there are no direct code-level dependencies, the historical co-change pattern and shared conceptual context suggest that `MMainWindow.java` should be reviewed for potential updates whenever `PageChecker.java` is changed.\n\nIn summary, based on the co-change relationships and the degree of conceptual coupling, it is recommended to synchronize changes for both `DefaultPageChecker.java` and `MMainWindow.java` when modifying `PageChecker.java`. The change set is ordered according to the strength of the evidence supporting the need for synchronization, with `DefaultPageChecker.java` being more closely aligned with `PageChecker.java` in terms of conceptual similarity and thus placed first in the change set.",

This means that every time `PageChecker.java` was changed in the project's version history, `DefaultPageChecker.java` was also changed. Furthermore, the conceptual coupling between these two entities is quite high with a semantic similarity probability of `0.8358329`. Although no direct coupling dependencies were found, the strong co-change pattern and conceptual relatedness indicate that changes to `PageChecker.java` very likely necessitate changes to `DefaultPageChecker.java`.\n\n2. **MMainWindow.java**: Similarly, `MMainWindow.java` has a co-change relationship with `PageChecker.java`, showing a support count of 1 and a confidence of 1.0. The conceptual coupling between `PageChecker.java` and `MMainWindow.java` also indicates a significant semantic similarity with a probability of `0.7990099`. While there are no direct code-level dependencies, the historical co-change pattern and shared conceptual context suggest that `MMainWindow.java` should be reviewed for potential updates whenever `PageChecker.java` is changed.\n\nIn summary, based on the co-change relationships and the degree of conceptual coupling, it is recommended to synchronize changes for both `DefaultPageChecker.java` and `MMainWindow.java` when modifying `PageChecker.java`. The change set is ordered according to the strength of the evidence supporting the need for synchronization, with `DefaultPageChecker.java` being more closely aligned with `PageChecker.java` in terms of conceptual similarity and thus placed first in the change set.",

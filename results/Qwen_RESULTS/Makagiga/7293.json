Additionally, there is a high conceptual coupling with a semantic similarity probability of approximately 0.869. These strong conceptual ties suggest that changes to `EnumProperty.java` are likely to necessitate corresponding modifications in `Property.java` to maintain functional consistency and correctness.\n\n2. **PropertyPanel**: Similarly, this entity also has a historical co-change relationship with `EnumProperty.java`, showing a support count of 1 and a confidence of 1.0. The conceptual coupling analysis reveals a semantic similarity probability of about 0.836. While slightly lower than that of `Property.java`, this still indicates a significant conceptual connection. Changes to `EnumProperty.java` may impact `PropertyPanel.java`, requiring synchronized modifications to ensure the system remains coherent and functional.\n\nThe elements in the Change set are sorted in descending order of the likelihood of synchronized modifications based on the strength of their conceptual coupling and historical co-change patterns.

Additionally, there is a high conceptual coupling with a semantic similarity probability of approximately 0.869.

The conceptual coupling analysis reveals a semantic similarity probability of about 0.836. While slightly lower than that of `Property.java`, this still indicates a significant conceptual connection. Changes to `EnumProperty.java` may impact `PropertyPanel.java`, requiring synchronized modifications to ensure the system remains coherent and functional.\n\nThe elements in the Change set are sorted in descending order of the likelihood of synchronized modifications based on the strength of their conceptual coupling and historical co-change patterns.

Furthermore, it has a very high conceptual coupling score, indicating that changes to `PluginClassLoader.java` are likely to necessitate corresponding changes in `PluginManager`.\n\n2. **DeskletLoader**  \n   - Support: 2\n   - Confidence: 0.4\n   - Conceptual Coupling: 0.720\n   - Explanation: Although `DeskletLoader` has lower support and confidence than `PluginManager`, it still shows a significant relationship through co-changes. The notable conceptual coupling suggests that it is also important to consider synchronizing changes between these two entities.\n\n3. **Armor**  \n   - Support: 2\n   - Confidence: 0.4\n   - Explanation: With a similar level of confidence as `DeskletLoader`, `Armor` has been changed alongside `PluginClassLoader.java` in the past, but we do not have information on its conceptual coupling. However, due to the support count and confidence, it should be considered for synchronization.\n\n4. **LookAndFeelPlugin**  \n   - Support: 1\n   - Confidence: 0.2\n   - Explanation: This entity has a low support count and confidence, but it appeared in the co-change list, so it might need attention if there are changes affecting UI-related components.\n\nEntities from this point onward have the lowest support and confidence, and no additional analysis was performed on them. They are listed here for completeness, but they are less likely to require synchronization:\n\n5. **Desktop**\n   - Support: 1\n   - Confidence: 0.2\n\n6. **Title**\n   - Support: 1\n   - Confidence: 0.2\n\n7. **DeskletWidget**\n   - Support: 1\n   - Confidence: 0.2\n\n8. **NotepadEditorDesigner**\n   - Support: 1\n   - Confidence: 0.2\n\n9. **AppletPanel**\n   - Support: 1\n   - Confidence: 0.2\n\n10. **TestPermission**\n    - Support: 1\n    - Confidence: 0.2\n\n11. **MetaInfo**\n    - Support: 1\n    - Confidence: 0.2\n\n12. **Permission**\n    - Support: 1\n    - Confidence: 0.2\n\n13. **Plugin**\n    - Support: 1\n    - Confidence: 0.2\n\n14. **SecurityDialog**\n    - Support: 1\n    - Confidence: 0.2\n\n15. **MasterKey**\n    - Support: 1\n    - Confidence: 0.2\n\nIn summary, based on historical co-change patterns and conceptual coupling, `PluginManager` and `DeskletLoader` are the primary candidates for synchronized modification when changes are made to `PluginClassLoader.java`.

Furthermore, it has a very high conceptual coupling score, indicating that changes to `PluginClassLoader.java` are likely to necessitate corresponding changes in `PluginManager`.\n\n2. **DeskletLoader**  \n   - Support: 2\n   - Confidence: 0.4\n   - Conceptual Coupling: 0.720\n   - Explanation: Although `DeskletLoader` has lower support and confidence than `PluginManager`, it still shows a significant relationship through co-changes. The notable conceptual coupling suggests that it is also important to consider synchronizing changes between these two entities.\n\n3. **Armor**  \n   - Support: 2\n   - Confidence: 0.4\n   - Explanation: With a similar level of confidence as `DeskletLoader`, `Armor` has been changed alongside `PluginClassLoader.java` in the past, but we do not have information on its conceptual coupling. However, due to the support count and confidence, it should be considered for synchronization.\n\n4. **LookAndFeelPlugin**  \n   - Support: 1\n   - Confidence: 0.2\n   - Explanation: This entity has a low support count and confidence, but it appeared in the co-change list, so it might need attention if there are changes affecting UI-related components.\n\nEntities from this point onward have the lowest support and confidence, and no additional analysis was performed on them. They are listed here for completeness, but they are less likely to require synchronization:\n\n5. **Desktop**\n   - Support: 1\n   - Confidence: 0.2\n\n6. **Title**\n   - Support: 1\n   - Confidence: 0.2\n\n7. **DeskletWidget**\n   - Support: 1\n   - Confidence: 0.2\n\n8. **NotepadEditorDesigner**\n   - Support: 1\n   - Confidence: 0.2\n\n9. **AppletPanel**\n   - Support: 1\n   - Confidence: 0.2\n\n10. **TestPermission**\n    - Support: 1\n    - Confidence: 0.2\n\n11. **MetaInfo**\n    - Support: 1\n    - Confidence: 0.2\n\n12. **Permission**\n    - Support: 1\n    - Confidence: 0.2\n\n13. **Plugin**\n    - Support: 1\n    - Confidence: 0.2\n\n14. **SecurityDialog**\n    - Support: 1\n    - Confidence: 0.2\n\n15. **MasterKey**\n    - Support: 1\n    - Confidence: 0.2\n\nIn summary, based on historical co-change patterns and conceptual coupling, `PluginManager` and `DeskletLoader` are the primary candidates for synchronized modification when changes are made to `PluginClassLoader.java`.

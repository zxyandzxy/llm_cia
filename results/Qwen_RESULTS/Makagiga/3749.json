Although no direct coupling dependencies or calls were found, its frequent appearance with `MMainWindow.java` points towards potential indirect relationships or shared functionalities.\n\n3. **FeedViewer**: It shares a confidence level of 0.25 with `MMainWindow.java`, which implies that changes in `MMainWindow.java` might require reviewing this entity for necessary updates.\n\n4. **Browser**: Similar to `FeedViewer`, it has been changed together with `MMainWindow.java` 2 out of 8 times with a confidence of 0.25, indicating a moderate chance of requiring synchronization.\n\n5. **MURLButton**: Also appearing with a support count of 2 and confidence of 0.25, this entity is included in the change set due to its co-change history with `MMainWindow.java`.\n\n6. **AutoCompletion**: It has appeared once in the co-change history of `MMainWindow.java`, with a confidence of 0.125. While less likely than the previous entities, it's still considered due to its past association.\n\n7. **Main**: With a single occurrence in the co-change history and a confidence of 0.125, it is included lower in the list but should still be reviewed if significant changes are made to `MMainWindow.java`.\n\n8. **MSystemTray**: Like `Main`, it also has a single support count and a confidence of 0.125. It's included because of its co-change relationship but ranks lower due to lower confidence.\n\n9. **MTip**: It appears once in the co-change history, with a confidence of 0.125.

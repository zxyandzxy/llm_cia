In order to help solve the CIA mission, you should first understand some necessary concepts\uff1a\n(1)entity: Entities represent source code files in CIA tasks, and all the CIA tasks under study are based on the Java language, so entities are files with the .java extension.\n(2)starting entity: The starting entity is also called salient entity, and the salient entity is the root change that causes the modification of the rest of entities in a change set, while the rest of entities are the dependency modification along with the salient one.\nYou will be presented with a starting entity and tools (functions) will be provided to access the more information of the origin system. Your task is to gradually explain which entity really need to be synchronized, based on the starting entity and the information obtained through the function-call.

This high co-change frequency suggests that both entities are often updated together, possibly because they share related functionalities or settings.\n\n2. **ExtraKiosk**: It has been modified 4 times out of 8 changes made to `Kiosk.java`, giving it a confidence level of 0.5. The name similarity suggests that these two entities might be closely related, even though there are no direct code dependencies found between them.\n\n3. **MURLButton**: Modified 3 times alongside `Kiosk.java` with a confidence of 0.375. This indicates that it may require updates if changes in `Kiosk.java` affect its behavior or configuration.\n\n4. **MText**: Co-changed twice, with a confidence of 0.25. Given this relatively lower confidence, it should still be reviewed as part of the change set but may not always need modification when `Kiosk.java` changes.\n\n5. **TaskTable**: Like `MText`, it has a confidence level of 0.25 based on being changed 2 times along with `Kiosk.java`. It should be included for review due to the possibility of shared functionality or settings.\n\n6. **ChartDialog**: Also co-changed twice, with a confidence of 0.25. While less likely than the top five, it has shown some association with `Kiosk.java` in past modifications.\n\n7. **NoteWidget**: Similar to `ChartDialog` and `TaskTable`, it has been changed 2 times with a confidence of 0.25. It's included in the change set for the same reasons mentioned above.\n\nIn summary, while there are no explicit coupling or conceptual dependencies detected, the historical co-change data provides strong evidence that these entities should be considered for potential synchronized changes when modifying `Kiosk.java`.

The name similarity suggests that these two entities might be closely related, even though there are no direct code dependencies found between them.\n\n3. **MURLButton**: Modified 3 times alongside `Kiosk.java` with a confidence of 0.375.

It should be included for review due to the possibility of shared functionality or settings.\n\n6. **ChartDialog**: Also co-changed twice, with a confidence of 0.25.

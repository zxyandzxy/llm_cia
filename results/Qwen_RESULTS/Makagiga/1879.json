TaskTable (Supports: 9, Confidence: 0.346)\n   - **Explanation:** TaskTable extends MTable (Inheritance coupling). Changes in the parent class `MTable.java` can directly impact its child class `TaskTable.java`. Therefore, when modifying `MTable.java`, it is crucial to also update `TaskTable.java` to ensure consistency and prevent potential issues.\n\n2. TodoEditorCore (Supports: 6, Confidence: 0.231; Conceptual Coupling: 0.847)\n   - **Explanation:** Although there's no direct coupling between `MTable.java` and `TodoEditorCore.java`, they share a strong conceptual relationship with a semantic similarity probability of approximately 0.847. This indicates that both entities are likely involved in similar tasks or share common functionality, necessitating their concurrent modification.\n\n3. ColumnManager (Supports: 4, Confidence: 0.154)\n   - **Explanation:** With a moderate confidence level, `ColumnManager` has been frequently modified alongside `MTable.java`. It is probable that `ColumnManager` manages columns within tables, which makes it relevant for updates when changes occur in table structures defined by `MTable.java`.\n\n4. RowIterator (Supports: 3, Confidence: 0.115)\n   - **Explanation:** Given the support count and confidence score, `RowIterator` is often changed with `MTable.java`. This suggests that `RowIterator` may be used to traverse rows within tables, making it necessary to adapt to changes in table structure or behavior.\n\n5. Renderer (Supports: 2, Confidence: 0.077)\n   - **Explanation:** The co-change pattern indicates that `Renderer` might be responsible for rendering content related to tables, and thus should be updated in tandem with `MTable.java` to maintain visual integrity.\n\n6. SaveAsDefaultAction (Supports: 2, Confidence: 0.077)\n   - **Explanation:** This action could be tied to saving default settings or configurations associated with tables, implying that any changes in table properties managed by `MTable.java` would require adjustments here as well.\n\n7. CompleteRenderer (Supports: 1, Confidence: 0.038)\n   - **Explanation:** With lower support but still showing up in co-changes, `CompleteRenderer` might have specific roles in rendering complex table contents, warranting consideration during modifications to `MTable.java`.\n\n8. MTableHeader (Supports: 2, Confidence: 0.077)\n   - **Explanation:** Likely involved in managing table headers, `MTableHeader` should be aligned with changes in table structure or appearance dictated by `MTable.java`.\n\n9. ProxyPanel (Supports: 1, Confidence: 0.038)\n   - **Explanation:** Could be a panel proxying table interactions or displaying table-related information, hence requiring updates when `MTable.java` evolves.\n\n10. DateTimeEditor (Supports: 2, Confidence: 0.077)\n    - **Explanation:** Possibly an editor for date-time values within tables, suggesting its relevance in scenarios where table editing capabilities are altered.\n\n11. SummaryEditor (Supports: 2, Confidence: 0.077)\n    - **Explanation:** If this editor aggregates or summarizes table data, it must reflect any changes in how data is structured or presented by `MTable.java`.\n\n12. ChartModel (Supports: 1, Confidence: 0.038)\n    - **Explanation:** Might represent chart models linked to table data visualization, potentially needing updates when table data handling changes.\n\n13. ConsoleConfig (Supports: 2, Confidence: 0.077)\n    - **Explanation:** Configurations for console outputs or behaviors that interact with tables, requiring synchronization if table interaction logic is modified.\n\n14. Console (Supports: 2, Confidence: 0.077)\n    - **Explanation:** Potentially displays table-related logs or outputs, ensuring it remains consistent with any changes in table operations.\n\n15. Model (Supports: 1, Confidence: 0.038)\n    - **Explanation:** Represents underlying data models that could be influenced by changes in table structure or behavior, though with less certainty due to lower support.\n\nThis change set reflects entities that are most likely to need synchronized modifications with `MTable.java` based on historical co-change patterns and inferred relationships.",

TaskTable (Supports: 9, Confidence: 0.346)\n   - **Explanation:** TaskTable extends MTable (Inheritance coupling). Changes in the parent class `MTable.java` can directly impact its child class `TaskTable.java`. Therefore, when modifying `MTable.java`, it is crucial to also update `TaskTable.java` to ensure consistency and prevent potential issues.\n\n2. TodoEditorCore (Supports: 6, Confidence: 0.231; Conceptual Coupling: 0.847)\n   - **Explanation:** Although there's no direct coupling between `MTable.java` and `TodoEditorCore.java`, they share a strong conceptual relationship with a semantic similarity probability of approximately 0.847. This indicates that both entities are likely involved in similar tasks or share common functionality, necessitating their concurrent modification.\n\n3. ColumnManager (Supports: 4, Confidence: 0.154)\n   - **Explanation:** With a moderate confidence level, `ColumnManager` has been frequently modified alongside `MTable.java`. It is probable that `ColumnManager` manages columns within tables, which makes it relevant for updates when changes occur in table structures defined by `MTable.java`.\n\n4. RowIterator (Supports: 3, Confidence: 0.115)\n   - **Explanation:** Given the support count and confidence score, `RowIterator` is often changed with `MTable.java`. This suggests that `RowIterator` may be used to traverse rows within tables, making it necessary to adapt to changes in table structure or behavior.\n\n5. Renderer (Supports: 2, Confidence: 0.077)\n   - **Explanation:** The co-change pattern indicates that `Renderer` might be responsible for rendering content related to tables, and thus should be updated in tandem with `MTable.java` to maintain visual integrity.\n\n6. SaveAsDefaultAction (Supports: 2, Confidence: 0.077)\n   - **Explanation:** This action could be tied to saving default settings or configurations associated with tables, implying that any changes in table properties managed by `MTable.java` would require adjustments here as well.\n\n7. CompleteRenderer (Supports: 1, Confidence: 0.038)\n   - **Explanation:** With lower support but still showing up in co-changes, `CompleteRenderer` might have specific roles in rendering complex table contents, warranting consideration during modifications to `MTable.java`.\n\n8. MTableHeader (Supports: 2, Confidence: 0.077)\n   - **Explanation:** Likely involved in managing table headers, `MTableHeader` should be aligned with changes in table structure or appearance dictated by `MTable.java`.\n\n9. ProxyPanel (Supports: 1, Confidence: 0.038)\n   - **Explanation:** Could be a panel proxying table interactions or displaying table-related information, hence requiring updates when `MTable.java` evolves.\n\n10. DateTimeEditor (Supports: 2, Confidence: 0.077)\n    - **Explanation:** Possibly an editor for date-time values within tables, suggesting its relevance in scenarios where table editing capabilities are altered.\n\n11. SummaryEditor (Supports: 2, Confidence: 0.077)\n    - **Explanation:** If this editor aggregates or summarizes table data, it must reflect any changes in how data is structured or presented by `MTable.java`.\n\n12. ChartModel (Supports: 1, Confidence: 0.038)\n    - **Explanation:** Might represent chart models linked to table data visualization, potentially needing updates when table data handling changes.\n\n13. ConsoleConfig (Supports: 2, Confidence: 0.077)\n    - **Explanation:** Configurations for console outputs or behaviors that interact with tables, requiring synchronization if table interaction logic is modified.\n\n14. Console (Supports: 2, Confidence: 0.077)\n    - **Explanation:** Potentially displays table-related logs or outputs, ensuring it remains consistent with any changes in table operations.\n\n15. Model (Supports: 1, Confidence: 0.038)\n    - **Explanation:** Represents underlying data models that could be influenced by changes in table structure or behavior, though with less certainty due to lower support.\n\nThis change set reflects entities that are most likely to need synchronized modifications with `MTable.java` based on historical co-change patterns and inferred relationships.",

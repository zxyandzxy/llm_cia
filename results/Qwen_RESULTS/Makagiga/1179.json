Moreover, it has a high semantic similarity probability (around 0.849) with `MountPanel.java`, indicating a strong conceptual relationship. Due to this combined evidence from co-change history and semantic coupling, it is highly likely that changes in `MountPanel.java` will require corresponding changes in `AdvancedProperties`.\n\n2. **PluginMenu**: Although there are no direct coupling dependencies between `MountPanel.java` and `PluginMenu`, they have appeared together in version histories with a support count of 1 and a confidence level of 0.5. This suggests that changes in `MountPanel.java` might be related to `PluginMenu`, possibly due to shared functionality or indirect dependencies.\n\n3. **TagsMenu**: Similar to `PluginMenu`, `TagsMenu` shares a co-change history with `MountPanel.java` (support count of 1 and confidence level of 0.5). Despite the lack of direct coupling dependencies, it's worth considering `TagsMenu` for potential synchronization if the context of the change relates to its functionality.\n\n4. **AbstractFS**: The co-change analysis indicates that `AbstractFS` was modified concurrently with `MountPanel.java` once, with a confidence of 0.5. While there is no evidence of direct coupling dependencies, it could still be prudent to review `AbstractFS` when changing `MountPanel.java` to ensure that any related updates are made.\n\n5. **PropertiesPanel**: Like the previous entities, `PropertiesPanel` has shown up in the co-change list with a support count of 1 and a confidence level of 0.5. There are no known coupling dependencies between `PropertiesPanel` and `MountPanel.java`, but given their past co-changes, it should be considered during the modification of `MountPanel.java`.\n\nIn summary, while `AdvancedProperties` stands out as the most critical entity to synchronize with `MountPanel.java`, the other entities (`PluginMenu`, `TagsMenu`, `AbstractFS`, and `PropertiesPanel`) should also be reviewed for potential necessary changes based on their historical co-modification patterns.",

Moreover, it has a high semantic similarity probability (around 0.849) with `MountPanel.java`, indicating a strong conceptual relationship. Due to this combined evidence from co-change history and semantic coupling, it is highly likely that changes in `MountPanel.java` will require corresponding changes in `AdvancedProperties`.\n\n2. **PluginMenu**: Although there are no direct coupling dependencies between `MountPanel.java` and `PluginMenu`, they have appeared together in version histories with a support count of 1 and a confidence level of 0.5. This suggests that changes in `MountPanel.java` might be related to `PluginMenu`, possibly due to shared functionality or indirect dependencies.\n\n3. **TagsMenu**: Similar to `PluginMenu`, `TagsMenu` shares a co-change history with `MountPanel.java` (support count of 1 and confidence level of 0.5). Despite the lack of direct coupling dependencies, it's worth considering `TagsMenu` for potential synchronization if the context of the change relates to its functionality.\n\n4. **AbstractFS**: The co-change analysis indicates that `AbstractFS` was modified concurrently with `MountPanel.java` once, with a confidence of 0.5. While there is no evidence of direct coupling dependencies, it could still be prudent to review `AbstractFS` when changing `MountPanel.java` to ensure that any related updates are made.\n\n5. **PropertiesPanel**: Like the previous entities, `PropertiesPanel` has shown up in the co-change list with a support count of 1 and a confidence level of 0.5. There are no known coupling dependencies between `PropertiesPanel` and `MountPanel.java`, but given their past co-changes, it should be considered during the modification of `MountPanel.java`.\n\nIn summary, while `AdvancedProperties` stands out as the most critical entity to synchronize with `MountPanel.java`, the other entities (`PluginMenu`, `TagsMenu`, `AbstractFS`, and `PropertiesPanel`) should also be reviewed for potential necessary changes based on their historical co-modification patterns.",

In order to help solve the CIA mission, you should first understand some necessary concepts\uff1a\n(1)entity: Entities represent source code files in CIA tasks, and all the CIA tasks under study are based on the Java language, so entities are files with the .java extension.\n(2)starting entity: The starting entity is also called salient entity, and the salient entity is the root change that causes the modification of the rest of entities in a change set, while the rest of entities are the dependency modification along with the salient one.\nYou will be presented with a starting entity and tools (functions) will be provided to access the more information of the origin system. Your task is to gradually explain which entity really need to be synchronized, based on the starting entity and the information obtained through the function-call. You have 7 chances to call the function to get more information."

This strong co-change history combined with significant semantic similarity indicates a high likelihood that any modifications to `ComponentDragAdapter.java` will necessitate changes in `MDialog`.\n\n2. **ProxySettings**: Co-changed 1 time with a confidence level of 1.0 and has the highest conceptual coupling score among all entities at 0.8332. The high semantic relationship suggests that `ProxySettings` should be synchronized whenever `ComponentDragAdapter.java` is modified.\n\n3. **MNotification**: Co-changed 1 time with a confidence level of 1.0 and has a conceptual coupling score of 0.8212. While slightly lower than `MDialog` and `ProxySettings`, this still indicates a strong relationship, making it likely that changes will also impact `MNotification`.\n\n4. **ProxyPanel**: Co-changed 1 time with a confidence level of 1.0 and has a conceptual coupling score of 0.8131. Although it has the lowest conceptual coupling score within this change set, the perfect co-change confidence implies that it should be considered for synchronization as well.\n\nIt's important to note that `CachedImageView` was removed from the project and therefore is not included in the change set.

Your task is to gradually explain which entity really need to be synchronized, based on the starting entity and the information obtained through the function-call.

In order to help solve the CIA mission, you should first understand some necessary concepts\uff1a\n(1)entity: Entities represent source code files in CIA tasks, and all the CIA tasks under study are based on the Java language, so entities are files with the .java extension.\n(2)starting entity: The starting entity is also called salient entity, and the salient entity is the root change that causes the modification of the rest of entities in a change set, while the rest of entities are the dependency modification along with the salient one.\nYou will be presented with a starting entity and tools (functions) will be provided to access the more information of the origin system. Your task is to gradually explain which entity really need to be synchronized, based on the starting entity and the information obtained through the function-call. You have 7 chances to call the function to get more information."

This suggests that changes to `FormPanel.java` often require corresponding changes in `MLoginPanel`, likely due to shared functionality or context.\n- **TextEditor**: Co-changed with `FormPanel.java` twice, but no direct coupling dependencies were found. The lack of coupling may imply that any required synchronization could be due to broader application-level context rather than direct code interaction.\n- **ImportExport**: Similarly co-changed with `FormPanel.java` twice without any coupling dependencies. It's possible that these entities share similar contexts within the project where changes in one might necessitate changes in the other.\n- **ShowHTMLAction**: Though it was included in the co-change list, this class has been removed from the newer versions of the project and thus is not relevant for current CIA considerations.\n- **Other Entities**: These entities have lower support counts and confidence levels and also do not exhibit any coupling dependencies with `FormPanel.java`.

This suggests that changes to `FormPanel.java` often require corresponding changes in `MLoginPanel`, likely due to shared functionality or context.\n- **TextEditor**: Co-changed with `FormPanel.java` twice, but no direct coupling dependencies were found. The lack of coupling may imply that any required synchronization could be due to broader application-level context rather than direct code interaction.\n- **ImportExport**: Similarly co-changed with `FormPanel.java` twice without any coupling dependencies. It's possible that these entities share similar contexts within the project where changes in one might necessitate changes in the other.\n- **ShowHTMLAction**: Though it was included in the co-change list, this class has been removed from the newer versions of the project and thus is not relevant for current CIA considerations.\n- **Other Entities**: These entities have lower support counts and confidence levels and also do not exhibit any coupling dependencies with `FormPanel.java`.

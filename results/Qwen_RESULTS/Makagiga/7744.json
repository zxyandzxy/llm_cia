Furthermore, despite there being no coupling dependencies or call references detected, the conceptual coupling score of `0.84258664` suggests that these two files are semantically similar and likely deal with related functionalities. Therefore, it is highly recommended to synchronize changes between these two entities.\n\n2. **SecurityDialog**: Although `SecurityDialog.java` shows a strong co-change relationship with `PermissionInfo.java` (with a support count of 1 and confidence of 1.0), it has been removed from the project due to version iteration. This means that any historical co-change pattern is not applicable anymore, as the file does not exist in the current codebase.

Furthermore, despite there being no coupling dependencies or call references detected, the conceptual coupling score of `0.84258664` suggests that these two files are semantically similar and likely deal with related functionalities. Therefore, it is highly recommended to synchronize changes between these two entities.\n\n2. **SecurityDialog**: Although `SecurityDialog.java` shows a strong co-change relationship with `PermissionInfo.java` (with a support count of 1 and confidence of 1.0), it has been removed from the project due to version iteration. This means that any historical co-change pattern is not applicable anymore, as the file does not exist in the current codebase. Thus, while it appears in the change set based on past data, it should not be considered for synchronization in the present context.\n\nIn conclusion, the analysis recommends synchronizing changes primarily with `MPermission.java`, while disregarding `SecurityDialog.java` since it is no longer part of the current project version.",

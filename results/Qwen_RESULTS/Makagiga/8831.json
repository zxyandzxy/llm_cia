Additionally, it has a high conceptual coupling probability of approximately 0.843, indicating that changes to `Query.java` often require corresponding changes to `SearchBar` due to their shared functionality or purpose.\n\n2. **MetaInfoList**: This entity appears in the co-change list with a support count of 3 and confidence of 0.3. Although we did not perform further analysis on this entity, its co-change frequency suggests a significant relationship with `Query.java`, necessitating a review for potential synchronized changes.\n\n3. **QueryEditor**: It also has a support count of 3 and confidence of 0.3, indicating that it frequently changes alongside `Query.java`. While there is no direct evidence of coupling dependencies or conceptual coupling, its frequent co-changes suggest a functional relationship that may require synchronized modifications.\n\n4. **Criterium**: This entity has a support count of 2 and confidence of 0.2. Though it has a lower co-change frequency compared to the top three entities, it still indicates some level of dependency that could require synchronized changes when `Query.java` is modified.\n\n5. **TodoCommand**: Similar to `Criterium`, `TodoCommand` has a support count of 2 and confidence of 0.2. Its inclusion in the change set is based on historical co-change patterns, which imply that changes might be necessary to maintain consistency across these files.\n\n6. **Submenu**: With a support count of 2 and confidence of 0.2, `Submenu` shows up as another candidate for synchronized changes. The co-change pattern suggests a need to review this file when `Query.java` is updated.\n\n7. **Tags**: Directly called by `Query.java` and listed in the co-change results, `Tags` is included in the change set. Changes in `Query.java` can affect how `Tags` operates within the system, making it a candidate for synchronization.\n\n8. **FSQuery**: Also directly called by `Query.java`, `FSQuery` is part of the call graph and appears in the co-change list. Given its direct interaction with `Query.java`, any changes made to `Query.java` should consider the impact on `FSQuery`.\n\nIn summary, the given change set prioritizes entities based on their likelihood of requiring synchronized modifications with `Query.java`.

Additionally, it has a high conceptual coupling probability of approximately 0.843, indicating that changes to `Query.java` often require corresponding changes to `SearchBar` due to their shared functionality or purpose.\n\n2. **MetaInfoList**: This entity appears in the co-change list with a support count of 3 and confidence of 0.3. Although we did not perform further analysis on this entity, its co-change frequency suggests a significant relationship with `Query.java`, necessitating a review for potential synchronized changes.\n\n3. **QueryEditor**: It also has a support count of 3 and confidence of 0.3, indicating that it frequently changes alongside `Query.java`. While there is no direct evidence of coupling dependencies or conceptual coupling, its frequent co-changes suggest a functional relationship that may require synchronized modifications.\n\n4. **Criterium**: This entity has a support count of 2 and confidence of 0.2.

Its inclusion in the change set is based on historical co-change patterns, which imply that changes might be necessary to maintain consistency across these files.\n\n6. **Submenu**: With a support count of 2 and confidence of 0.2, `Submenu` shows up as another candidate for synchronized changes. The co-change pattern suggests a need to review this file when `Query.java` is updated.\n\n7. **Tags**: Directly called by `Query.java` and listed in the co-change results, `Tags` is included in the change set. Changes in `Query.java` can affect how `Tags` operates within the system, making it a candidate for synchronization.\n\n8. **FSQuery**: Also directly called by `Query.java`, `FSQuery` is part of the call graph and appears in the co-change list.

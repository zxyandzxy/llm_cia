The conceptual coupling between them is also strong, with a semantic similarity probability of ~0.71.\n\n3. **DnDTransferHandler.java**: It has a support count of 2 and a confidence level of approximately 0.33. While there's no direct evidence of coupling dependencies or conceptual similarities, its frequent co-changes suggest some underlying relationship worth considering for synchronization.\n\n4. **ImageTransferHandler.java**: Similar to `DnDTransferHandler.java`, it has a support count of 2 and a confidence level of approximately 0.33. Although not directly analyzed for coupling or conceptual similarities, its history of co-changes makes it relevant for potential synchronization.\n\n5. **Index.java**: With a support count of 1 and a confidence level of approximately 0.17, it has less evidence supporting the need for synchronization compared to the top entities but should still be considered due to past co-change occurrences.\n\n6. **Links.java**: Also having a support count of 1 and a confidence level of approximately 0.17, it appears in the co-change history and may require synchronization based on historical patterns.\n\n7. **NoteWidgetPlugin.java**: Like `Index.java` and `Links.java`, it has a support count of 1 and a confidence level of approximately 0.17, suggesting it could be impacted by changes to `MDataTransfer.java`.\n\n8. **TaskTable.java**: Another entity with a support count of 1 and a confidence level of approximately 0.17, indicating potential relevance for synchronization based on co-change history.\n\n9. **InsertImageAction.java**: Similarly, it has a support count of 1 and a confidence level of approximately 0.17, making it a candidate for consideration in the change set.\n\n10. **FileSelection.java**: Having a support count of 1 and a confidence level of approximately 0.17, it might be influenced by changes in `MDataTransfer.java` as indicated by past co-changes.\n\n11. **MClipboard.java**: Lastly, it also has a support count of 1 and a confidence level of approximately 0.17, rounding out the list of entities that have historically been changed along with `MDataTransfer.java`.\n\nIn conclusion, the entities in the change set are ordered based on their support counts and confidence levels from the co-change relationship function.

The conceptual coupling between them is also strong, with a semantic similarity probability of ~0.71.\n\n3. **DnDTransferHandler.java**: It has a support count of 2 and a confidence level of approximately 0.33. While there's no direct evidence of coupling dependencies or conceptual similarities, its frequent co-changes suggest some underlying relationship worth considering for synchronization.\n\n4. **ImageTransferHandler.java**: Similar to `DnDTransferHandler.java`, it has a support count of 2 and a confidence level of approximately 0.33. Although not directly analyzed for coupling or conceptual similarities, its history of co-changes makes it relevant for potential synchronization.\n\n5. **Index.java**: With a support count of 1 and a confidence level of approximately 0.17, it has less evidence supporting the need for synchronization compared to the top entities but should still be considered due to past co-change occurrences.\n\n6. **Links.java**: Also having a support count of 1 and a confidence level of approximately 0.17, it appears in the co-change history and may require synchronization based on historical patterns.\n\n7. **NoteWidgetPlugin.java**: Like `Index.java` and `Links.java`, it has a support count of 1 and a confidence level of approximately 0.17, suggesting it could be impacted by changes to `MDataTransfer.java`.\n\n8. **TaskTable.java**: Another entity with a support count of 1 and a confidence level of approximately 0.17, indicating potential relevance for synchronization based on co-change history.\n\n9. **InsertImageAction.java**: Similarly, it has a support count of 1 and a confidence level of approximately 0.17, making it a candidate for consideration in the change set.\n\n10. **FileSelection.java**: Having a support count of 1 and a confidence level of approximately 0.17, it might be influenced by changes in `MDataTransfer.java` as indicated by past co-changes.\n\n11. **MClipboard.java**: Lastly, it also has a support count of 1 and a confidence level of approximately 0.17, rounding out the list of entities that have historically been changed along with `MDataTransfer.java`.\n\nIn conclusion, the entities in the change set are ordered based on their support counts and confidence levels from the co-change relationship function.

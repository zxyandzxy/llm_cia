In order to help solve the CIA mission, you should first understand some necessary concepts\uff1a\n(1)entity: Entities represent source code files in CIA tasks, and all the CIA tasks under study are based on the Java language, so entities are files with the .java extension.\n(2)starting entity: The starting entity is also called salient entity, and the salient entity is the root change that causes the modification of the rest of entities in a change set, while the rest of entities are the dependency modification along with the salient one.\nYou will be presented with a starting entity and tools (functions) will be provided to access the more information of the origin system. Your task is to gradually explain which entity really need to be synchronized, based on the starting entity and the information obtained through the function-call. You have 7 chances to call the function to get more information."

Additionally, the conceptual coupling score between `ImageView.java` and `MScrollPane.java` is relatively high at 0.829, indicating a strong semantic similarity.

The conceptual coupling score is slightly lower but still significant at 0.825. This indicates a similar level of semantic similarity and implies that these entities may need to be considered together when making changes, even though no direct code dependencies were found.\n\n- **ComponentHighlight.java**: Although it appeared in the co-change results, it has been removed from the project due to version iteration. Its inclusion in the change set is based on historical data; however, since it's no longer part of the project, it does not require synchronization in current development efforts.\n\nThe elements in the Change set are sorted in descending order of the likelihood of synchronized modifications, considering the confidence of co-changes and the conceptual coupling scores.

In order to help solve the CIA mission, you should first understand some necessary concepts\uff1a\n(1)entity: Entities represent source code files in CIA tasks, and all the CIA tasks under study are based on the Java language, so entities are files with the .java extension.\n(2)starting entity: The starting entity is also called salient entity, and the salient entity is the root change that causes the modification of the rest of entities in a change set, while the rest of entities are the dependency modification along with the salient one.\nYou will be presented with a starting entity and tools (functions) will be provided to access the more information of the origin system. Your task is to gradually explain which entity really need to be synchronized, based on the starting entity and the information obtained through the function-call.

Additionally, the conceptual coupling score between `ImageView.java` and `MScrollPane.java` is relatively high at 0.829, indicating a strong semantic similarity.

The conceptual coupling score is slightly lower but still significant at 0.825. This indicates a similar level of semantic similarity and implies that these entities may need to be considered together when making changes, even though no direct code dependencies were found.\n\n- **ComponentHighlight.java**: Although it appeared in the co-change results, it has been removed from the project due to version iteration.

However, it has been noted that `Permission` has been removed from the project due to project version iteration. As such, while historically relevant, it is no longer part of the current codebase and does not need to be considered for synchronization in future changes. Its inclusion here serves as a historical reference rather than an actionable item.\n\nBased on this analysis, when modifying `Gettext.java`, special attention should be given to `Armor` due to its high likelihood of requiring synchronized modifications.

Additionally, the conceptual coupling score of 0.854 indicates a significant semantic similarity between these two entities. Despite the lack of direct coupling dependencies, the historical co-occurrence and shared concepts suggest that changes to `Gettext.java` likely require corresponding changes to `Armor`.\n\n2. **Permission**: This entity appeared alongside `Gettext.java` during co-change analysis with a support count of 1 and a confidence of 1.0. However, it has been noted that `Permission` has been removed from the project due to project version iteration. As such, while historically relevant, it is no longer part of the current codebase and does not need to be considered for synchronization in future changes. Its inclusion here serves as a historical reference rather than an actionable item.\n\nBased on this analysis, when modifying `Gettext.java`, special attention should be given to `Armor` due to its high likelihood of requiring synchronized modifications.

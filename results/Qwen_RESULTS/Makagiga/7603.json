Co-change analysis has shown that `InternetSearchPlugin.java` is frequently changed together with `InternetSearchPanel.java`.\n2. Call graph analysis revealed several entities directly called by `InternetSearchPanel.java`, including `PluginDownloader.java` and `MWebBrowserPanel.java`.\n3.

Additionally, since `PluginDownloader.java` appeared in both co-change and call graph results, it should also be considered for synchronization despite the lack of direct coupling dependencies.

The conceptual coupling score is also very high at 0.741, indicating a strong semantic relationship with `InternetSearchPanel.java`. Changes to `InternetSearchPanel.java` are highly likely to necessitate changes in `InternetSearchPlugin`.\n\n2. `CustomSearchAction`: With support and confidence values of 2 and 0.222 respectively, this entity is often modified alongside `InternetSearchPanel.java`, suggesting a moderate dependency that may require synchronization.\n\n3. `InternetSearchAction`: Similarly to `CustomSearchAction`, it shares the same support and confidence values, making it another candidate for potential synchronized modifications.\n\n4. `UninstallOpenSearchPluginAction`: Also sharing the same support and confidence as `InternetSearchAction`, this entity should be considered for synchronization due to its frequent co-occurrence with `InternetSearchPanel.java` in past code modifications.\n\n5. `Action`: Although it shares the same support and confidence as the previous two entities, it's more generic and might not have as direct an impact on `InternetSearchPanel.java` as the others listed above.\n\n6. `PluginDownloader`: It appeared in both the co-change list and the call graph, which indicates that while there is no direct coupling dependency, it is often changed together with `InternetSearchPanel.java` and used by it, so it might need to be updated accordingly.\n\n7. `MWebBrowserPanel`: This entity was found in the call graph, meaning it is directly called by `InternetSearchPanel.java`. Even though there is no direct coupling dependency, its usage suggests that any significant change in `InternetSearchPanel.java` could affect `MWebBrowserPanel`.\n\n8. `MDownloadDialog`: This entity was also found in the call graph, indicating it is utilized by `InternetSearchPanel.java`. It may require synchronization depending on the nature of the changes made.\n\n9. `MApplication`: While this entity is part of the call graph and thus directly interacts with `InternetSearchPanel.java`, it is a broader class and less likely to require changes compared to more specific classes. However, due to its foundational role, it is included in the change set for consideration.\n\nIn summary, based on co-change patterns and call graph dependencies, these entities are recommended for synchronization when changes are made to `InternetSearchPanel.java`.

Your task is to gradually explain which entity really need to be synchronized, based on the starting entity and the information obtained through the function-call. You have 7 chances to call the function to get more information."

Co-change analysis has shown that `InternetSearchPlugin.java` is frequently changed together with `InternetSearchPanel.java`.\n2. Call graph analysis revealed several entities directly called by `InternetSearchPanel.java`, including `PluginDownloader.java` and `MWebBrowserPanel.java`.\n3.

The conceptual coupling score is also very high at 0.741, indicating a strong semantic relationship with `InternetSearchPanel.java`. Changes to `InternetSearchPanel.java` are highly likely to necessitate changes in `InternetSearchPlugin`.\n\n2. `CustomSearchAction`: With support and confidence values of 2 and 0.222 respectively, this entity is often modified alongside `InternetSearchPanel.java`, suggesting a moderate dependency that may require synchronization.\n\n3. `InternetSearchAction`: Similarly to `CustomSearchAction`, it shares the same support and confidence values, making it another candidate for potential synchronized modifications.\n\n4. `UninstallOpenSearchPluginAction`: Also sharing the same support and confidence as `InternetSearchAction`, this entity should be considered for synchronization due to its frequent co-occurrence with `InternetSearchPanel.java` in past code modifications.\n\n5. `Action`: Although it shares the same support and confidence as the previous two entities, it's more generic and might not have as direct an impact on `InternetSearchPanel.java` as the others listed above.\n\n6. `PluginDownloader`: It appeared in both the co-change list and the call graph, which indicates that while there is no direct coupling dependency, it is often changed together with `InternetSearchPanel.java` and used by it, so it might need to be updated accordingly.\n\n7. `MWebBrowserPanel`: This entity was found in the call graph, meaning it is directly called by `InternetSearchPanel.java`. Even though there is no direct coupling dependency, its usage suggests that any significant change in `InternetSearchPanel.java` could affect `MWebBrowserPanel`.\n\n8. `MDownloadDialog`: This entity was also found in the call graph, indicating it is utilized by `InternetSearchPanel.java`. It may require synchronization depending on the nature of the changes made.\n\n9. `MApplication`: While this entity is part of the call graph and thus directly interacts with `InternetSearchPanel.java`, it is a broader class and less likely to require changes compared to more specific classes. However, due to its foundational role, it is included in the change set for consideration.\n\nIn summary, based on co-change patterns and call graph dependencies, these entities are recommended for synchronization when changes are made to `InternetSearchPanel.java`.

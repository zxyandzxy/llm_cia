In order to help solve the CIA mission, you should first understand some necessary concepts\uff1a\n(1)entity: Entities represent source code files in CIA tasks, and all the CIA tasks under study are based on the Java language, so entities are files with the .java extension.\n(2)starting entity: The starting entity is also called salient entity, and the salient entity is the root change that causes the modification of the rest of entities in a change set, while the rest of entities are the dependency modification along with the salient one.\nYou will be presented with a starting entity and tools (functions) will be provided to access the more information of the origin system. Your task is to gradually explain which entity really need to be synchronized, based on the starting entity and the information obtained through the function-call. You have 7 chances to call the function to get more information."

It also has appeared together with `PrintBuilder.java` in changes twice, giving it a confidence level of 0.5. This high semantic similarity and co-change frequency indicate that changes to `PrintBuilder.java` are likely to necessitate changes to `DocumentPrint.java`.\n\n2. **TodoWidget.java**: Although there are no direct coupling dependencies between these two entities, they have a conceptual coupling score of 0.709, which indicates a relatively high semantic similarity. They have been changed together twice, with a confidence of 0.5, suggesting that changes in `PrintBuilder.java` may require corresponding changes in `TodoWidget.java`.\n\n3. **NotepadEditorDesigner.java**: While there are no coupling dependencies or significant conceptual similarity indicated by the tools, this entity has appeared alongside `PrintBuilder.java` in changes twice, with a confidence of 0.5. Therefore, it's prudent to consider it for potential synchronization.\n\n4. **MHTMLViewer.java, MTable.java, MStatusBar.java, MApplication.java, MLogger.java, MMessage.java, TK.java, MComponent.java, UI.java, MDisposable.java**: These entities directly interact with `PrintBuilder.java` through method calls or references as shown by the call graph analysis. Changes in `PrintBuilder.java` could potentially affect these entities due to their direct interaction, even though they did not appear in the co-change relationship results.\n\nIn summary, while the first three entities (DocumentPrint.java, TodoWidget.java, NotepadEditorDesigner.java) show historical evidence of being modified together with `PrintBuilder.java`, the last ten entities (from MHTMLViewer.java to MDisposable.java) have direct interactions with `PrintBuilder.java`, making them candidates for synchronized changes when `PrintBuilder.java` is altered.

They have been changed together twice, with a confidence of 0.5, suggesting that changes in `PrintBuilder.java` may require corresponding changes in `TodoWidget.java`.\n\n3. **NotepadEditorDesigner.java**: While there are no coupling dependencies or significant conceptual similarity indicated by the tools, this entity has appeared alongside `PrintBuilder.java` in changes twice, with a confidence of 0.5.

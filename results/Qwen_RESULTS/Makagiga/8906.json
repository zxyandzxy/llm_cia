Even though there are no direct coupling dependencies, changes to `Armor.java` may imply necessary adjustments in `MDialog` due to their shared context or functionality.\n\n2. **SecurityDialog**: This entity has appeared multiple times (2 supports) with a confidence value of 0.18 when `Armor.java` was changed. This suggests that changes in `Armor.java` often require corresponding changes in `SecurityDialog`, possibly because they share common security-related functionalities or interactions.\n\n3. **MPermission**: With 2 supports and a confidence of 0.18, this entity also frequently co-changes with `Armor.java`. Despite the lack of direct coupling dependencies, it's likely that `Armor.java` and `MPermission` are related through their roles in managing permissions within the system.\n\n4. **PluginPermission**: Similarly to `MPermission`, `PluginPermission` shares the same support count and confidence level. It implies that any change in `Armor.java` might affect how plugin permissions are handled, which makes it another candidate for synchronization.\n\n5. **Permission**: Also appearing with 2 supports and a confidence of 0.18, `Permission` is another entity that tends to be modified alongside `Armor.java`. It's possible that both entities are involved in permission handling mechanisms, necessitating their synchronization during code updates.\n\n6. **ScriptIDE**: Although `ScriptIDE` does not have explicit coupling with `Armor.java`, it has been co-changed with `Armor.java` twice out of eleven changes, resulting in a confidence level of 0.18. This suggests a potential indirect dependency or shared feature area that requires coordinated modifications.\n\nOther entities from the co-change list can be considered if further analysis indicates a need for synchronization.

Even though there are no direct coupling dependencies, changes to `Armor.java` may imply necessary adjustments in `MDialog` due to their shared context or functionality.\n\n2. **SecurityDialog**: This entity has appeared multiple times (2 supports) with a confidence value of 0.18 when `Armor.java` was changed. This suggests that changes in `Armor.java` often require corresponding changes in `SecurityDialog`, possibly because they share common security-related functionalities or interactions.\n\n3. **MPermission**: With 2 supports and a confidence of 0.18, this entity also frequently co-changes with `Armor.java`. Despite the lack of direct coupling dependencies, it's likely that `Armor.java` and `MPermission` are related through their roles in managing permissions within the system.\n\n4. **PluginPermission**: Similarly to `MPermission`, `PluginPermission` shares the same support count and confidence level. It implies that any change in `Armor.java` might affect how plugin permissions are handled, which makes it another candidate for synchronization.\n\n5. **Permission**: Also appearing with 2 supports and a confidence of 0.18, `Permission` is another entity that tends to be modified alongside `Armor.java`. It's possible that both entities are involved in permission handling mechanisms, necessitating their synchronization during code updates.\n\n6. **ScriptIDE**: Although `ScriptIDE` does not have explicit coupling with `Armor.java`, it has been co-changed with `Armor.java` twice out of eleven changes, resulting in a confidence level of 0.18. This suggests a potential indirect dependency or shared feature area that requires coordinated modifications.\n\nOther entities from the co-change list can be considered if further analysis indicates a need for synchronization.

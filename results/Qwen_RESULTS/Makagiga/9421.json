In order to help solve the CIA mission, you should first understand some necessary concepts\uff1a\n(1)entity: Entities represent source code files in CIA tasks, and all the CIA tasks under study are based on the Java language, so entities are files with the .java extension.\n(2)starting entity: The starting entity is also called salient entity, and the salient entity is the root change that causes the modification of the rest of entities in a change set, while the rest of entities are the dependency modification along with the salient one.\nYou will be presented with a starting entity and tools (functions) will be provided to access the more information of the origin system. Your task is to gradually explain which entity really need to be synchronized, based on the starting entity and the information obtained through the function-call. You have 7 chances to call the function to get more information."

This suggests that while they may share similar functionality, changes in `TextUtils.java` might not always require changes in `MText`. However, given the high semantic similarity, it's prudent to review `MText` when changes are made to `TextUtils.java`.\n\n3. **MHighlighter**: As an entity directly referenced by `TextUtils.java`, it could potentially be impacted by changes to text utilities. However, no coupling dependencies were found between them. It should still be reviewed for potential indirect impacts.\n\n4. **UI**: Since `UI` is also directly referenced by `TextUtils.java`, it might use some of the functionalities provided by `TextUtils.java`.

They are listed here as they have method calls or variable references to `TextUtils.java` and might need to be inspected for potential impacts when `TextUtils.java` is changed. However, since we did not find any direct coupling dependencies with these entities, their inclusion in the change set is based on their usage context rather than structural dependency. \n\nIt's important to note that while the function calls did not reveal direct coupling dependencies, the call graph indicates that these entities interact with `TextUtils.java`.

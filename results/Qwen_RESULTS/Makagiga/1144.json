Although no direct coupling dependencies were found, the high co-change frequency suggests that they are often modified together, possibly due to shared architectural purposes or related features.\n\n- **TreeFS:** Appearing five times during co-changes (confidence of 0.15625), this entity also directly interacts with `Tree.java`, as indicated by the call graph analysis. Therefore, it should be included in the change set for synchronization.\n\n- **Summary & SummaryPanel:** Both entities have appeared four times in the co-change history with `Tree.java` (confidence of 0.125). Their frequent co-changes suggest they may share common functionalities or depend on each other's data structures.\n\n- **AbstractFS, Query, FSHelper, Scanner, Vars, ItemRenderer, Tracker, DnDTransferHandler, Sidebar, Tabs:** These entities have varying levels of support counts and confidence scores but appear in the call graph of `Tree.java`, indicating direct dependencies.

The conceptual coupling score of 0.71 further supports its inclusion in the change set, indicating that it shares similar functionality or is part of the same feature set.\n  \n- **MTree:** This entity has been changed alongside `Tree.java` six times (confidence of 0.1875). Although no direct coupling dependencies were found, the high co-change frequency suggests that they are often modified together, possibly due to shared architectural purposes or related features.\n\n- **TreeFS:** Appearing five times during co-changes (confidence of 0.15625), this entity also directly interacts with `Tree.java`, as indicated by the call graph analysis. Therefore, it should be included in the change set for synchronization.\n\n- **Summary & SummaryPanel:** Both entities have appeared four times in the co-change history with `Tree.java` (confidence of 0.125). Their frequent co-changes suggest they may share common functionalities or depend on each other's data structures.\n\n- **AbstractFS, Query, FSHelper, Scanner, Vars, ItemRenderer, Tracker, DnDTransferHandler, Sidebar, Tabs:** These entities have varying levels of support counts and confidence scores but appear in the call graph of `Tree.java`, indicating direct dependencies.

Additionally, the conceptual coupling between these two entities is notably strong, with a semantic similarity probability of approximately 0.896. This indicates that they are likely to share common functionality or context within the Makagiga project.

Although there are no direct coupling dependencies between them, the conceptual coupling analysis shows a moderate semantic similarity probability of around 0.774.

Although there are no direct coupling dependencies between them, the conceptual coupling analysis shows a moderate semantic similarity probability of around 0.774.

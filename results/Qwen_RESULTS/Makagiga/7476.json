Since `DnDTransferHandler` and `LinkEditorPlugin` have shown up multiple times in co-changes with `ImportExport.java`, even though they do not directly interact based on the call graph and coupling dependency analyses, they might still need to be updated due to indirect reasons such as shared functionality or context.\n\nSince I have used up most of my function calls, let's summarize:\n\n- Entities that are highly recommended for synchronization due to historical co-changes and conceptual coupling include `MainWindow`.\n- Despite the lack of direct interaction or coupling dependencies, `DnDTransferHandler` and `LinkEditorPlugin` also show strong evidence of needing synchronization due to their frequent co-changes with `ImportExport.java`.\n\nTherefore, it would be prudent to synchronize changes across `ImportExport.java`, `MainWindow`, `DnDTransferHandler`, and `LinkEditorPlugin`.

Since `DnDTransferHandler` and `LinkEditorPlugin` have shown up multiple times in co-changes with `ImportExport.java`, even though they do not directly interact based on the call graph and coupling dependency analyses, they might still need to be updated due to indirect reasons such as shared functionality or context.\n\nSince I have used up most of my function calls, let's summarize:\n\n- Entities that are highly recommended for synchronization due to historical co-changes and conceptual coupling include `MainWindow`.\n- Despite the lack of direct interaction or coupling dependencies, `DnDTransferHandler` and `LinkEditorPlugin` also show strong evidence of needing synchronization due to their frequent co-changes with `ImportExport.java`.\n\nTherefore, it would be prudent to synchronize changes across `ImportExport.java`, `MainWindow`, `DnDTransferHandler`, and `LinkEditorPlugin`.

Since there is no evidence of direct call relationships or coupling dependencies, their inclusion in the change set is based on historical co-change patterns rather than structural code dependencies.\n\nIt's important to note that while these entities appear in the change history alongside `Mnemonic.java`, the low confidence values suggest weak correlations. However, due to the lack of other more definitive indicators such as call graphs or coupling dependencies, we consider these entities for potential review. Among them, `FormPanel` stands out due to its higher conceptual coupling with `Mnemonic.java`. The rest of the entities should be reviewed primarily based on the fact that they were changed together with `Mnemonic.java` in the past, although with low confidence, which could indicate that changes might propagate to them under certain circumstances.

Your task is to gradually explain which entity really need to be synchronized, based on the starting entity and the information obtained through the function-call.

Additionally, the conceptual coupling between these two entities is quite high (approximately 0.81), suggesting that they share significant semantic similarities and functional dependencies. Therefore, any changes to `ProxyInfo.java` are very likely to necessitate corresponding adjustments in `ProxyModel`.\n\n2. **`ProxyPanel`**: The co-change analysis reveals that `ProxyPanel` has a significant co-change relationship with `ProxyInfo.java`, appearing together in changes 2 out of 3 times (confidence level of approximately 0.67). Although there are no direct coupling dependencies, the historical evidence of co-changes suggests that these entities are closely related within the system's functionality, making it important to consider synchronizing them.\n\n3. **`TK`**: This entity directly interacts with `ProxyInfo.java` through static method invocations. The specific calls (`checkNull` and `range`) indicate that `TK` provides utility functions used within `ProxyInfo`. Since `ProxyInfo.java` depends on `TK` for these operations, any modifications to `ProxyInfo` could potentially impact the methods provided by `TK`, or vice versa.

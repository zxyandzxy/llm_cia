These are likely utility classes or components used within the chart painting functionality.\n\nSince we didn't find direct coupling dependencies between `ChartPainter.java` and its co-changed entities (`ChartView`, `ChartDialog`), let's further investigate if there is any conceptual coupling by checking the semantic similarity between `ChartPainter.java` and one of its co-changed entities, like `ChartView`.

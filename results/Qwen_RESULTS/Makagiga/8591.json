Furthermore, the conceptual coupling probability between these two entities is very high (0.864), suggesting a strong semantic relationship.\n\n2. **DateTimeDialog.java**: With a support count of 5 and a confidence level of 0.217, this entity frequently co-changes with `MCalendarPanel.java`. It's likely involved in related functionality or shares dependencies that require synchronization.\n\n3. **DayButton.java**: Similar to `DateTimeDialog.java`, this entity also has a support count of 5 and a confidence level of 0.217. Given its name, it could be part of the calendar UI components that need alignment with changes in `MCalendarPanel.java`.\n\n4. **SummaryData.java**: Having been changed together with `MCalendarPanel.java` 5 times out of 23, it has a confidence level of 0.217. Its co-change pattern suggests a potential shared data structure or logic requiring updates when `MCalendarPanel.java` changes.\n\n5. **MDateSpinner.java**: Co-changed 4 times with a confidence of 0.174, it might be another component used within the calendar panel for date selection, necessitating concurrent modifications.\n\n6. **CalendarComponent.java**: With a support count of 4 and a confidence level of 0.174, it may represent a base class or interface that `MCalendarPanel.java` depends on, thus requiring attention during changes.\n\n7. **Events.java, DateAction.java, MonthAction.java, Renderer.java, Updater.java, GlassPainter.java, CategoryListRenderer.java, DebugOutputStream.java, TaskReader.java, SummaryTree.java, WeekLabel.java, SetDateTimeAction.java, SessionManager.java, TaskTable.java, Input.java, MComponent.java, Info.java**: These entities have lower support counts ranging from 1 to 2, and their confidence levels vary from 0.043 to 0.087. While they show less frequent co-change patterns compared to the top entities, they still indicate some form of dependency or shared functionality with `MCalendarPanel.java`. Careful consideration should be given to any changes impacting these files, especially if they relate to similar aspects of the application's logic or UI components.\n\nIn summary, the above change set includes entities that are most likely to require synchronized modifications with `MCalendarPanel.java` based on historical co-change patterns and conceptual relationships.

Furthermore, the conceptual coupling probability between these two entities is very high (0.864), suggesting a strong semantic relationship.\n\n2. **DateTimeDialog.java**: With a support count of 5 and a confidence level of 0.217, this entity frequently co-changes with `MCalendarPanel.java`. It's likely involved in related functionality or shares dependencies that require synchronization.\n\n3. **DayButton.java**: Similar to `DateTimeDialog.java`, this entity also has a support count of 5 and a confidence level of 0.217. Given its name, it could be part of the calendar UI components that need alignment with changes in `MCalendarPanel.java`.\n\n4. **SummaryData.java**: Having been changed together with `MCalendarPanel.java` 5 times out of 23, it has a confidence level of 0.217. Its co-change pattern suggests a potential shared data structure or logic requiring updates when `MCalendarPanel.java` changes.\n\n5. **MDateSpinner.java**: Co-changed 4 times with a confidence of 0.174, it might be another component used within the calendar panel for date selection, necessitating concurrent modifications.\n\n6. **CalendarComponent.java**: With a support count of 4 and a confidence level of 0.174, it may represent a base class or interface that `MCalendarPanel.java` depends on, thus requiring attention during changes.\n\n7. **Events.java, DateAction.java, MonthAction.java, Renderer.java, Updater.java, GlassPainter.java, CategoryListRenderer.java, DebugOutputStream.java, TaskReader.java, SummaryTree.java, WeekLabel.java, SetDateTimeAction.java, SessionManager.java, TaskTable.java, Input.java, MComponent.java, Info.java**: These entities have lower support counts ranging from 1 to 2, and their confidence levels vary from 0.043 to 0.087.

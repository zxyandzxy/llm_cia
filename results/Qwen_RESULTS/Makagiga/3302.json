Moreover, it appeared alongside `EditorPlugin.java` in 4 out of 11 modifications, giving it a confidence of 0.36.

Furthermore, `MainWindow.java` was modified together with `EditorPlugin.java` 4 times out of 11, showing a confidence of 0.36. Therefore, it is important to synchronize changes for this entity.\n\n- **ImageEditorPlugin.java & LinkEditorPlugin.java**: Both entities have been changed along with `EditorPlugin.java` three times out of eleven (confidence of 0.27). While the conceptual coupling wasn't checked for these entities, their frequent co-changes suggest a potential need for synchronization when modifying `EditorPlugin.java`.\n\n- **TreeFS.java & ImportExport.java**: These two entities were modified together with `EditorPlugin.java` twice out of eleven (confidence of 0.18). The lower confidence compared to the previous entities suggests a less strong relationship but still worth considering for synchronization due to the co-change history.\n\n- **PluginManager.java, NotepadEditorPlugin.java, TextEditorPlugin.java**: Each of these entities shares a single co-change instance with `EditorPlugin.java` (confidence of 0.09). Their inclusion in the change set is based on the minimal evidence of co-change; however, given the low confidence, the necessity for synchronization may be less critical compared to the higher-ranked entities.\n\nThe elements in the Change set are sorted in descending order of the likelihood of synchronized modifications, with the first two entries having the strongest evidence for synchronization based on both conceptual coupling and co-change frequency.

Moreover, it appeared alongside `EditorPlugin.java` in 4 out of 11 modifications, giving it a confidence of 0.36.

Furthermore, `MainWindow.java` was modified together with `EditorPlugin.java` 4 times out of 11, showing a confidence of 0.36.

While the conceptual coupling wasn't checked for these entities, their frequent co-changes suggest a potential need for synchronization when modifying `EditorPlugin.java`.\n\n- **TreeFS.java & ImportExport.java**: These two entities were modified together with `EditorPlugin.java` twice out of eleven (confidence of 0.18). The lower confidence compared to the previous entities suggests a less strong relationship but still worth considering for synchronization due to the co-change history.\n\n- **PluginManager.java, NotepadEditorPlugin.java, TextEditorPlugin.java**: Each of these entities shares a single co-change instance with `EditorPlugin.java` (confidence of 0.09).

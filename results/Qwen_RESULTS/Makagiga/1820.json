Furthermore, the conceptual coupling probability between `IconLoader.java` and `MIcon` is 0.787, which indicates a significant semantic relationship. Both code-level and conceptual dependencies make it highly likely that changes to `IconLoader.java` will require corresponding changes in `MIcon`.\n\n2. **DefaultIconLoader** & **TangoIconLoader**: Although we did not perform specific function calls for these entities, they share a similar naming pattern and functionality related to icon loading, suggesting they might be subclasses or implementations of different icon loading strategies. Changes in `IconLoader.java` could imply changes in how icons are loaded, affecting these classes.\n\n3. **IconTheme**: Since this entity is related to themes for icons, any change in the way icons are handled by `IconLoader.java` could have implications for how icon themes are managed. Therefore, it should be considered for synchronization.\n\n4. **IconSizePreview**: This entity may rely on `IconLoader.java` to display previews of different icon sizes. If there are changes in how icons are loaded, the preview mechanism might need adjustments as well.\n\n5. **StatsDialog**, **LookAndFeelSettings**, **FeedViewer**, **Browser**, **DoneComponent**, **TodoEditor**, **MTextFieldPanel**, **MURLButton**, **ChartDialog**: These entities do not show direct coupling dependencies with `IconLoader.java` according to our analysis. However, due to their co-change history, they were included in the list. The confidence of 1.0 implies that every time `IconLoader.java` was modified, these entities were also changed. While the reason for co-changes is not clear from the code-level dependencies, it's possible that these changes were part of broader feature updates or bug fixes that involved `IconLoader.java`. They are placed lower in the list due to the lack of direct evidence of dependency.\n\nIn conclusion, while `MIcon` has strong indications for needing synchronization, other entities like `DefaultIconLoader`, `TangoIconLoader`, `IconTheme`, and `IconSizePreview` might also require careful consideration during the modification of `IconLoader.java`. Entities further down the list should be reviewed in the context of the overall system changes but are less likely to need synchronization based on the provided analysis.",

Furthermore, the conceptual coupling probability between `IconLoader.java` and `MIcon` is 0.787, which indicates a significant semantic relationship. Both code-level and conceptual dependencies make it highly likely that changes to `IconLoader.java` will require corresponding changes in `MIcon`.\n\n2. **DefaultIconLoader** & **TangoIconLoader**: Although we did not perform specific function calls for these entities, they share a similar naming pattern and functionality related to icon loading, suggesting they might be subclasses or implementations of different icon loading strategies. Changes in `IconLoader.java` could imply changes in how icons are loaded, affecting these classes.\n\n3. **IconTheme**: Since this entity is related to themes for icons, any change in the way icons are handled by `IconLoader.java` could have implications for how icon themes are managed. Therefore, it should be considered for synchronization.\n\n4. **IconSizePreview**: This entity may rely on `IconLoader.java` to display previews of different icon sizes. If there are changes in how icons are loaded, the preview mechanism might need adjustments as well.\n\n5. **StatsDialog**, **LookAndFeelSettings**, **FeedViewer**, **Browser**, **DoneComponent**, **TodoEditor**, **MTextFieldPanel**, **MURLButton**, **ChartDialog**: These entities do not show direct coupling dependencies with `IconLoader.java` according to our analysis. However, due to their co-change history, they were included in the list. The confidence of 1.0 implies that every time `IconLoader.java` was modified, these entities were also changed. While the reason for co-changes is not clear from the code-level dependencies, it's possible that these changes were part of broader feature updates or bug fixes that involved `IconLoader.java`. They are placed lower in the list due to the lack of direct evidence of dependency.\n\nIn conclusion, while `MIcon` has strong indications for needing synchronization, other entities like `DefaultIconLoader`, `TangoIconLoader`, `IconTheme`, and `IconSizePreview` might also require careful consideration during the modification of `IconLoader.java`. Entities further down the list should be reviewed in the context of the overall system changes but are less likely to need synchronization based on the provided analysis.",

Although there is no direct coupling or call graph evidence, the conceptual similarity probability between these two entities is high (around 0.847), indicating that they share common functionality or purpose and thus likely require changes together.\n\n2. **DayButton.java**: It has appeared in the version history 5 times when `MCalendarPanel.java` was modified, with a confidence of 0.217. Given its frequent appearance with `MCalendarPanel.java`, it may be closely related to calendar functionalities and should be reviewed for synchronization.\n\n3. **DateTimeDialog.java**: Also changed 5 times along with `MCalendarPanel.java`, sharing the same confidence as `DayButton.java`. Its relevance to date and time operations suggests a need for concurrent updates when working with `MCalendarPanel.java`.\n\n4. **SummaryData.java**: With a support count of 5 and a confidence level of 0.217, this entity is often involved in changes related to data summarization and display, which could be interconnected with the calendar panel's functions.\n\n5. **MDateSpinner.java**: Changed 4 times with `MCalendarPanel.java`, having a confidence of 0.174. This entity is likely responsible for date selection and manipulation, making it relevant for potential concurrent modifications.\n\n6. **CalendarComponent.java**: Like `MDateSpinner.java`, this entity has also been modified 4 times with `MCalendarPanel.java`, with a confidence of 0.174. It seems to be part of the calendar components suite and might share dependencies with `MCalendarPanel.java`.\n\n7. **Renderer.java**: Appearing twice in the co-change records, with a confidence of 0.087, this entity could be related to visual representation aspects shared with `MCalendarPanel.java`.\n\n8. **SetDateTimeAction.java**: Similarly to `Renderer.java`, it has a support count of 2 and a confidence of 0.087, suggesting it plays a role in setting date-time values that may affect the calendar panel's behavior.\n\n9. **WeekLabel.java**: With a confidence of 0.087, this entity may contribute to labeling weeks within the calendar interface and thus could be impacted by changes in `MCalendarPanel.java`.\n\n10. **TaskTable.java**: Lastly, `TaskTable.java` also shares a low but notable co-change relationship with `MCalendarPanel.java`, appearing twice with a confidence of 0.087.

Although there is no direct coupling or call graph evidence, the conceptual similarity probability between these two entities is high (around 0.847), indicating that they share common functionality or purpose and thus likely require changes together.\n\n2. **DayButton.java**: It has appeared in the version history 5 times when `MCalendarPanel.java` was modified, with a confidence of 0.217. Given its frequent appearance with `MCalendarPanel.java`, it may be closely related to calendar functionalities and should be reviewed for synchronization.\n\n3. **DateTimeDialog.java**: Also changed 5 times along with `MCalendarPanel.java`, sharing the same confidence as `DayButton.java`. Its relevance to date and time operations suggests a need for concurrent updates when working with `MCalendarPanel.java`.\n\n4. **SummaryData.java**: With a support count of 5 and a confidence level of 0.217, this entity is often involved in changes related to data summarization and display, which could be interconnected with the calendar panel's functions.\n\n5. **MDateSpinner.java**: Changed 4 times with `MCalendarPanel.java`, having a confidence of 0.174. This entity is likely responsible for date selection and manipulation, making it relevant for potential concurrent modifications.\n\n6. **CalendarComponent.java**: Like `MDateSpinner.java`, this entity has also been modified 4 times with `MCalendarPanel.java`, with a confidence of 0.174. It seems to be part of the calendar components suite and might share dependencies with `MCalendarPanel.java`.\n\n7. **Renderer.java**: Appearing twice in the co-change records, with a confidence of 0.087, this entity could be related to visual representation aspects shared with `MCalendarPanel.java`.\n\n8. **SetDateTimeAction.java**: Similarly to `Renderer.java`, it has a support count of 2 and a confidence of 0.087, suggesting it plays a role in setting date-time values that may affect the calendar panel's behavior.\n\n9. **WeekLabel.java**: With a confidence of 0.087, this entity may contribute to labeling weeks within the calendar interface and thus could be impacted by changes in `MCalendarPanel.java`.\n\n10. **TaskTable.java**: Lastly, `TaskTable.java` also shares a low but notable co-change relationship with `MCalendarPanel.java`, appearing twice with a confidence of 0.087.

In order to help solve the CIA mission, you should first understand some necessary concepts\uff1a\n(1)entity: Entities represent source code files in CIA tasks, and all the CIA tasks under study are based on the Java language, so entities are files with the .java extension.\n(2)starting entity: The starting entity is also called salient entity, and the salient entity is the root change that causes the modification of the rest of entities in a change set, while the rest of entities are the dependency modification along with the salient one.\nYou will be presented with a starting entity and tools (functions) will be provided to access the more information of the origin system. Your task is to gradually explain which entity really need to be synchronized, based on the starting entity and the information obtained through the function-call. You have 7 chances to call the function to get more information."

Similar to `TrackerItem`, this entity's co-change frequency justifies its inclusion in the change set for further investigation.\n\n5. **FSHelper**: Co-changed 2 times with a confidence level of 16.67%. Its co-change history with `Tracker.java` makes it a candidate for synchronization, although no additional analysis was performed.\n\n6. **MainWindow**: Co-changed 2 times with a confidence level of 16.67%.

The conceptual coupling score between `Tracker.java` and `SummaryData` is 0.837, indicating a strong semantic relationship.

Similar to `TrackerItem`, this entity's co-change frequency justifies its inclusion in the change set for further investigation.\n\n5. **FSHelper**: Co-changed 2 times with a confidence level of 16.67%. Its co-change history with `Tracker.java` makes it a candidate for synchronization, although no additional analysis was performed.\n\n6. **MainWindow**: Co-changed 2 times with a confidence level of 16.67%.

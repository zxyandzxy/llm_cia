In order to help solve the CIA mission, you should first understand some necessary concepts\uff1a\n(1)entity: Entities represent source code files in CIA tasks, and all the CIA tasks under study are based on the Java language, so entities are files with the .java extension.\n(2)starting entity: The starting entity is also called salient entity, and the salient entity is the root change that causes the modification of the rest of entities in a change set, while the rest of entities are the dependency modification along with the salient one.\nYou will be presented with a starting entity and tools (functions) will be provided to access the more information of the origin system. Your task is to gradually explain which entity really need to be synchronized, based on the starting entity and the information obtained through the function-call. You have 7 chances to call the function to get more information."

Although there are no direct coupling dependencies detected, the strong conceptual relationship suggests that changes to `MLineBorder.java` may also require modifications to `MStatusBar.java` if they share common functionality or are part of similar feature sets within the project.\n\n2. `FlatPainter.java`: Similar to `MStatusBar.java`, this entity also shows a strong conceptual coupling with `MLineBorder.java`, evidenced by the even higher semantic similarity probability of `0.8489756`. The lack of direct coupling dependencies does not rule out the possibility that these two files could be involved in related aspects of the project, making it advisable to consider `FlatPainter.java` for synchronized changes when `MLineBorder.java` is modified.\n\nEntities such as `TabComponent.java` and `WeekLabel.java` have been removed from the project due to version iteration, so they do not need to be considered for synchronization.

Your task is to gradually explain which entity really need to be synchronized, based on the starting entity and the information obtained through the function-call.

Although there are no direct coupling dependencies detected, the strong conceptual relationship suggests that changes to `MLineBorder.java` may also require modifications to `MStatusBar.java` if they share common functionality or are part of similar feature sets within the project.\n\n2. `FlatPainter.java`: Similar to `MStatusBar.java`, this entity also shows a strong conceptual coupling with `MLineBorder.java`, evidenced by the even higher semantic similarity probability of `0.8489756`. The lack of direct coupling dependencies does not rule out the possibility that these two files could be involved in related aspects of the project, making it advisable to consider `FlatPainter.java` for synchronized changes when `MLineBorder.java` is modified.\n\nEntities such as `TabComponent.java` and `WeekLabel.java` have been removed from the project due to version iteration, so they do not need to be considered for synchronization.

In order to help solve the CIA mission, you should first understand some necessary concepts\uff1a\n(1)entity: Entities represent source code files in CIA tasks, and all the CIA tasks under study are based on the Java language, so entities are files with the .java extension.\n(2)starting entity: The starting entity is also called salient entity, and the salient entity is the root change that causes the modification of the rest of entities in a change set, while the rest of entities are the dependency modification along with the salient one.\nYou will be presented with a starting entity and tools (functions) will be provided to access the more information of the origin system. Your task is to gradually explain which entity really need to be synchronized, based on the starting entity and the information obtained through the function-call. You have 7 chances to call the function to get more information."

The high frequency suggests a strong functional or structural relationship.\n\n2. **SummaryPanel**: Similarly to Reminder, it also has a support count of 8 and confidence of 0.3076923076923077. Changes here are highly likely to affect `SummaryData.java`, indicating they are closely related.\n\n3. **SummaryTree**: It has a support count of 6 and confidence of 0.23076923076923078. This implies that when changes occur in `SummaryData.java`, there is a significant chance that `SummaryTree` will also require updates.\n\n4. **Action**: With a support count of 5 and confidence of 0.19230769230769232, Action has a moderate likelihood of requiring synchronization with `SummaryData.java`.\n\n5. **CalendarComponent**: Although its support count is lower at 3, the confidence remains relatively high at 0.11538461538461539, suggesting a need for change coordination.\n\n6. **TaskList**: Despite the lack of direct coupling dependencies, the high conceptual coupling indicates shared functionality. Therefore, changes in `SummaryData.java` may impact TaskList and vice versa.\n\n7. **Tracker**: Appears in the call graph of `SummaryData.java` and has been historically changed together, implying a need for synchronized changes.\n\n8. **MainWindow**: Another entity from the call graph which might need to be updated in conjunction with `SummaryData.java`.\n\n9. **Vars**: Also part of the call graph, suggesting potential dependency on changes within `SummaryData.java`.\n\nThe remaining entities follow a similar pattern, where their presence in the co-change history and interaction through calls suggest the need for synchronized changes. However, their lower support counts and confidences indicate less frequent but still possible dependencies. These should be reviewed carefully during code changes to ensure all interdependencies are accounted for. \n\nThis comprehensive analysis provides a prioritized list of entities that should be considered for synchronized changes when modifying `SummaryData.java`.",

Your task is to gradually explain which entity really need to be synchronized, based on the starting entity and the information obtained through the function-call.

Moreover, it shares a strong conceptual coupling with a semantic similarity probability of 0.857, indicating that changes in `TextEditor.java` are very likely to necessitate corresponding modifications in `TextEditorCore`.\n\n2. **TextEditorDesigner** - This entity also shows significant co-change frequency with 6 supports and a confidence level of 0.462. It has a high conceptual coupling with `TextEditor.java`, sharing a semantic similarity probability of 0.848. Therefore, it is essential to synchronize changes between these two entities.\n\n3. **CharacterAction** - Although it appears lower in the list with a support count of 3 and a confidence level of 0.231, it still indicates a moderate likelihood of requiring synchronized changes when modifying `TextEditor.java`.\n\n4. **TextEditorDocument** - Similarly to `CharacterAction`, this entity has a support count of 3 and a confidence level of 0.231. Given its co-change history with `TextEditor.java`, it should be considered for synchronization.\n\n5. **TextEditorKit** - Just like `TextEditorDocument` and `CharacterAction`, this entity has a support count of 3 and a confidence level of 0.231. The co-change relationship suggests it might need to be updated along with `TextEditor.java`.\n\n6. **InsertLinkAction** - This entity has appeared once in the change history along with `TextEditor.java`, which gives it a support count of 1 and a confidence level of 0.077. While the confidence is low, it's still included due to potential indirect dependencies or shared functionality.\n\n7. **TodoEditor** - With a support count of 2 and a confidence level of 0.154, this entity has a slightly higher chance of being modified alongside `TextEditor.java` than those with a single support count.\n\n8. **RichTextPane** - This entity shares a similar support count and confidence level as `TodoEditor`, making it a candidate for potential synchronized changes.\n\n9. **Factory** - Also with a support count of 2 and a confidence level of 0.154, it is included in the change set based on its co-change relationship with `TextEditor.java`.\n\n10. **Clear** - Lastly, this entity has a support count of 1 and a confidence level of 0.077.

This high degree of semantic relatedness further supports the idea that `TextEditorDesigner.java` should be synchronized when changes are made to `TextEditor.java`.\n\nIn summary, based on the co-change analysis and the conceptual coupling results, we have identified two entities that should be synchronized with `TextEditor.java` during modifications:\n\n1. `TextEditorCore.java` - due to its high co-change frequency and strong conceptual coupling.\n2. `TextEditorDesigner.java` - also due to its significant co-change frequency and strong conceptual coupling.\n\nThese findings suggest that any change in `TextEditor.java` is likely to affect these two additional entities, and they should be reviewed or updated accordingly to maintain consistency across the codebase.",

Moreover, it shares a strong conceptual coupling with a semantic similarity probability of 0.857, indicating that changes in `TextEditor.java` are very likely to necessitate corresponding modifications in `TextEditorCore`.\n\n2. **TextEditorDesigner** - This entity also shows significant co-change frequency with 6 supports and a confidence level of 0.462. It has a high conceptual coupling with `TextEditor.java`, sharing a semantic similarity probability of 0.848. Therefore, it is essential to synchronize changes between these two entities.\n\n3. **CharacterAction** - Although it appears lower in the list with a support count of 3 and a confidence level of 0.231, it still indicates a moderate likelihood of requiring synchronized changes when modifying `TextEditor.java`.\n\n4. **TextEditorDocument** - Similarly to `CharacterAction`, this entity has a support count of 3 and a confidence level of 0.231. Given its co-change history with `TextEditor.java`, it should be considered for synchronization.\n\n5. **TextEditorKit** - Just like `TextEditorDocument` and `CharacterAction`, this entity has a support count of 3 and a confidence level of 0.231. The co-change relationship suggests it might need to be updated along with `TextEditor.java`.\n\n6. **InsertLinkAction** - This entity has appeared once in the change history along with `TextEditor.java`, which gives it a support count of 1 and a confidence level of 0.077. While the confidence is low, it's still included due to potential indirect dependencies or shared functionality.\n\n7. **TodoEditor** - With a support count of 2 and a confidence level of 0.154, this entity has a slightly higher chance of being modified alongside `TextEditor.java` than those with a single support count.\n\n8. **RichTextPane** - This entity shares a similar support count and confidence level as `TodoEditor`, making it a candidate for potential synchronized changes.\n\n9. **Factory** - Also with a support count of 2 and a confidence level of 0.154, it is included in the change set based on its co-change relationship with `TextEditor.java`.\n\n10. **Clear** - Lastly, this entity has a support count of 1 and a confidence level of 0.077. Though it ranks lower in terms of support and confidence, it's included in the change set for thoroughness in ensuring all possible related changes are covered.\n\nThe elements in the Change set are sorted in descending order of the likelihood of synchronized modifications based on their support counts and confidence levels from the co-change analysis. Entities with higher support and confidence have a stronger historical correlation with `TextEditor.java`, suggesting they are more likely to require updates when `TextEditor.java` is changed.",

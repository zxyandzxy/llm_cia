Although there are no direct coupling dependencies, their strong conceptual relationship justifies the need for synchronized changes.\n\n2. **ImportExport**: This entity appears in the co-change history with `CalendarWidget.java` once, providing a support count of 1 and a confidence level of 0.33. While this is lower than that of `CalendarWidgetPlugin`, it still indicates a tendency to be changed together. Further analysis would be needed to determine the exact nature of their relationship.\n\n3. **LabelMenuAction**: Similarly to `ImportExport`, this entity has a low support count and confidence level. It shares the same confidence level of 0.33 as `ImportExport` and `CalendarComponent`. The reasons for their co-changes may not be immediately clear without further investigation into their functional relationships.\n\n4. **CalendarComponent**: This entity is included due to its appearance in the co-change list with a confidence level of 0.33. Given that it shares part of its name with `CalendarWidget.java`, it's plausible they have some shared functionality or dependency, even if indirect.\n\n5. **PluginManager**: With a single support and a confidence level of 0.33, this entity might be related to the management of plugins within the system. Its presence in the co-change results suggests a possible interaction with calendar-related plugins, including `CalendarWidgetPlugin`.\n\n6. **OptionsPanel**: This entity also has a low support count and confidence level. It might be involved in configuration settings or options that could affect the calendar widget's behavior, thus appearing in the co-change history.\n\nThe elements in the Change set are sorted in descending order of the likelihood of synchronized modifications based on the co-change confidence levels and additional conceptual coupling information. `CalendarWidgetPlugin` stands out as the most likely candidate for synchronization due to its higher confidence level and strong conceptual relationship with `CalendarWidget.java`.

Although there are no direct coupling dependencies, their strong conceptual relationship justifies the need for synchronized changes.\n\n2. **ImportExport**: This entity appears in the co-change history with `CalendarWidget.java` once, providing a support count of 1 and a confidence level of 0.33. While this is lower than that of `CalendarWidgetPlugin`, it still indicates a tendency to be changed together. Further analysis would be needed to determine the exact nature of their relationship.\n\n3. **LabelMenuAction**: Similarly to `ImportExport`, this entity has a low support count and confidence level. It shares the same confidence level of 0.33 as `ImportExport` and `CalendarComponent`. The reasons for their co-changes may not be immediately clear without further investigation into their functional relationships.\n\n4. **CalendarComponent**: This entity is included due to its appearance in the co-change list with a confidence level of 0.33. Given that it shares part of its name with `CalendarWidget.java`, it's plausible they have some shared functionality or dependency, even if indirect.\n\n5. **PluginManager**: With a single support and a confidence level of 0.33, this entity might be related to the management of plugins within the system. Its presence in the co-change results suggests a possible interaction with calendar-related plugins, including `CalendarWidgetPlugin`.\n\n6. **OptionsPanel**: This entity also has a low support count and confidence level. It might be involved in configuration settings or options that could affect the calendar widget's behavior, thus appearing in the co-change history.\n\nThe elements in the Change set are sorted in descending order of the likelihood of synchronized modifications based on the co-change confidence levels and additional conceptual coupling information. `CalendarWidgetPlugin` stands out as the most likely candidate for synchronization due to its higher confidence level and strong conceptual relationship with `CalendarWidget.java`.

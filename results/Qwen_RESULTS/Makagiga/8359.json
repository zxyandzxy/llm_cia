It also appeared together with `Cache.java` in past changes with a confidence level of 0.5, making it highly likely to require synchronization when `Cache.java` is modified.\n\n2. **FileCache.java**: Although there are no direct coupling dependencies between `Cache.java` and `FileCache.java`, they have been co-changed in the past with a confidence level of 0.5. Given this pattern, it's reasonable to consider synchronizing `FileCache.java` when modifying `Cache.java`.\n\n3. **Group.java**, **Entry.java**: Both entities were co-changed with `Cache.java` with a confidence level of 0.5.

Given this pattern, it's reasonable to consider synchronizing `FileCache.java` when modifying `Cache.java`.\n\n3. **Group.java**, **Entry.java**: Both entities were co-changed with `Cache.java` with a confidence level of 0.5.

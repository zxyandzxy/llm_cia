Although there are no direct coupling dependencies, it has a high conceptual similarity probability (approximately 0.845), suggesting that changes to `ImageEditor.java` will likely require corresponding adjustments in `ImageEditorCore`.\n\n2. **`TodoEditor`**: With a confidence level of 0.15 and appearing 3 times alongside `ImageEditor.java`, this entity is moderately likely to need synchronization. Its relationship with `ImageEditor.java` may not be as directly evident as with `ImageEditorCore`, but past co-changes suggest it could be affected by changes.\n\n3. **`ResizeDialog`**: Similarly to `TodoEditor`, this entity has a confidence level of 0.15 and appeared 3 times together with `ImageEditor.java`. It's reasonable to consider synchronizing changes due to its frequent appearance in past modifications.\n\n4. **`TextEditor` and `NotepadEditor`**: Both have a lower confidence level of 0.1, each appearing twice when `ImageEditor.java` was modified. While their necessity for synchronization is less certain compared to the top three entities, they should still be reviewed for potential impacts from changes made to `ImageEditor.java`.\n\n5. **`SelectionTool` and `BrushTool`**: These entities appear in both the call graph and the co-change analysis, indicating that `ImageEditor.java` directly interacts with them. Their exact co-change frequency is low (confidence of 0.05), but given their direct interaction, they are included in the change set to ensure all dependencies are accounted for during any modifications.\n\nIn conclusion, while the primary focus should be on `ImageEditorCore` due to its strong conceptual coupling and history of co-changes, attention should also be given to `TodoEditor`, `ResizeDialog`, `TextEditor`, `NotepadEditor`, `SelectionTool`, and `BrushTool` to ensure comprehensive coverage of possible ripple effects from changes to `ImageEditor.java`.",

Although there are no direct coupling dependencies, it has a high conceptual similarity probability (approximately 0.845), suggesting that changes to `ImageEditor.java` will likely require corresponding adjustments in `ImageEditorCore`.\n\n2. **`TodoEditor`**: With a confidence level of 0.15 and appearing 3 times alongside `ImageEditor.java`, this entity is moderately likely to need synchronization. Its relationship with `ImageEditor.java` may not be as directly evident as with `ImageEditorCore`, but past co-changes suggest it could be affected by changes.\n\n3. **`ResizeDialog`**: Similarly to `TodoEditor`, this entity has a confidence level of 0.15 and appeared 3 times together with `ImageEditor.java`. It's reasonable to consider synchronizing changes due to its frequent appearance in past modifications.\n\n4. **`TextEditor` and `NotepadEditor`**: Both have a lower confidence level of 0.1, each appearing twice when `ImageEditor.java` was modified. While their necessity for synchronization is less certain compared to the top three entities, they should still be reviewed for potential impacts from changes made to `ImageEditor.java`.\n\n5. **`SelectionTool` and `BrushTool`**: These entities appear in both the call graph and the co-change analysis, indicating that `ImageEditor.java` directly interacts with them. Their exact co-change frequency is low (confidence of 0.05), but given their direct interaction, they are included in the change set to ensure all dependencies are accounted for during any modifications.\n\nIn conclusion, while the primary focus should be on `ImageEditorCore` due to its strong conceptual coupling and history of co-changes, attention should also be given to `TodoEditor`, `ResizeDialog`, `TextEditor`, `NotepadEditor`, `SelectionTool`, and `BrushTool` to ensure comprehensive coverage of possible ripple effects from changes to `ImageEditor.java`.",

Despite the lack of direct coupling dependencies or conceptual similarity found through our tools, the historical pattern of co-changes suggests that there may be an indirect relationship or shared context that causes these two files to change together. Therefore, changes to `DropShadowBorder.java` should consider potential impacts on `QuotedPrintableCodec`.\n\n2. **UI**: Although not identified by the co-change relationship function, `UI.java` was revealed through the call graph analysis to have a relationship with `DropShadowBorder.java`. Moreover, the high semantic similarity probability of approximately 0.831 indicates a strong conceptual connection between these two entities. This implies that they likely share functionality or purpose, which means that modifications to `DropShadowBorder.java` are very likely to necessitate corresponding changes in `UI.java` to maintain consistency.\n\nThe elements in the Change set are sorted in descending order of the likelihood of synchronized modifications based on the evidence gathered during this analysis. `UI.java` is placed first due to the stronger evidence of a direct relationship and high conceptual similarity, while `QuotedPrintableCodec` is included due to its historical co-change pattern despite the lack of direct coupling or conceptual similarity detected. `LinkButton` is not included as it has been removed from the project and thus no longer relevant for synchronization.",

Despite the lack of direct coupling dependencies or conceptual similarity found through our tools, the historical pattern of co-changes suggests that there may be an indirect relationship or shared context that causes these two files to change together. Therefore, changes to `DropShadowBorder.java` should consider potential impacts on `QuotedPrintableCodec`.\n\n2. **UI**: Although not identified by the co-change relationship function, `UI.java` was revealed through the call graph analysis to have a relationship with `DropShadowBorder.java`. Moreover, the high semantic similarity probability of approximately 0.831 indicates a strong conceptual connection between these two entities. This implies that they likely share functionality or purpose, which means that modifications to `DropShadowBorder.java` are very likely to necessitate corresponding changes in `UI.java` to maintain consistency.\n\nThe elements in the Change set are sorted in descending order of the likelihood of synchronized modifications based on the evidence gathered during this analysis. `UI.java` is placed first due to the stronger evidence of a direct relationship and high conceptual similarity, while `QuotedPrintableCodec` is included due to its historical co-change pattern despite the lack of direct coupling or conceptual similarity detected. `LinkButton` is not included as it has been removed from the project and thus no longer relevant for synchronization.",

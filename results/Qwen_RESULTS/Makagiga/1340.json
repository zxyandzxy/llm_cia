This indicates some dependency, although not as strong as `TodoEditorCore`.\n\n3. **TodoEditorPlugin**: With a support count of 2 and a confidence level of 0.1, this entity tends to change alongside `TodoEditor.java`, suggesting a moderate need for synchronization.\n\n4. **ColumnManager**: Similarly to `TodoEditorPlugin`, this entity also has a support count of 2 and a confidence level of 0.1, implying a moderate chance of requiring concurrent modifications.\n\n5. **SearchBar**: Also appearing with a support count of 2 and a confidence level of 0.1, this entity should be considered for potential changes if `TodoEditor.java` is modified.\n\n6. **TextEditor**: Having a support count of 2 and a confidence level of 0.1, `TextEditor` shows a similar pattern of co-change with `TodoEditor.java`.\n\n7. **HTMLBuilder**: Like others in this list, it has a support count of 2 and a confidence level of 0.1, warranting consideration for synchronized changes.\n\n8. **MTable**: Although having a lower support count of 1 and a confidence level of 0.05, `MTable` has shown up in co-changes with `TodoEditor.java` and might require attention.\n\n9. **SortAction**: With a support count of 1 and a confidence level of 0.05, this entity is less likely but still potentially affected by changes to `TodoEditor.java`.\n\n10. **SummaryEditor**: Similar to `SortAction`, it has a support count of 1 and a confidence level of 0.05, indicating a weak but existing relationship.\n\n11. **SelectAllAction**: Also appearing once during co-changes with a confidence level of 0.05, it may need to be reviewed for synchronization.\n\n12. **UnselectAll**: Another entity with a support count of 1 and a confidence level of 0.05, which could be impacted by changes in `TodoEditor.java`.\n\n13. **AbstractSettings**: This entity also shares a low support count of 1 and a confidence level of 0.05, so it should be considered for possible review.\n\n14. **DeleteCompletedAction**: Given its appearance in one out of eight co-changes, with a confidence level of 0.05, it might require a check for necessary adjustments.\n\n15. **Vars**: While having a low support count of 1 and a confidence level of 0.05, `Vars` was identified in the call graph and thus should be included for potential synchronization.\n\n16. **Reminder**: Appearing only once with a confidence level of 0.05, it's listed due to its presence in the co-change results.\n\n17. **InsertLinkAction**: Lastly, this entity also appeared once during co-changes with a confidence level of 0.05, making it a candidate for review based on the co-change analysis.\n\nIn summary, entities at the top of the list have stronger evidence supporting the need for synchronized changes with `TodoEditor.java`.

However, the co-change relationship was weak.\n\nBased on this analysis, you should prioritize synchronizing changes with `TodoEditorCore` due to the high semantic similarity and historical co-change frequency.

This indicates some dependency, although not as strong as `TodoEditorCore`.\n\n3. **TodoEditorPlugin**: With a support count of 2 and a confidence level of 0.1, this entity tends to change alongside `TodoEditor.java`, suggesting a moderate need for synchronization.\n\n4. **ColumnManager**: Similarly to `TodoEditorPlugin`, this entity also has a support count of 2 and a confidence level of 0.1, implying a moderate chance of requiring concurrent modifications.\n\n5. **SearchBar**: Also appearing with a support count of 2 and a confidence level of 0.1, this entity should be considered for potential changes if `TodoEditor.java` is modified.\n\n6. **TextEditor**: Having a support count of 2 and a confidence level of 0.1, `TextEditor` shows a similar pattern of co-change with `TodoEditor.java`.\n\n7. **HTMLBuilder**: Like others in this list, it has a support count of 2 and a confidence level of 0.1, warranting consideration for synchronized changes.\n\n8. **MTable**: Although having a lower support count of 1 and a confidence level of 0.05, `MTable` has shown up in co-changes with `TodoEditor.java` and might require attention.\n\n9. **SortAction**: With a support count of 1 and a confidence level of 0.05, this entity is less likely but still potentially affected by changes to `TodoEditor.java`.\n\n10. **SummaryEditor**: Similar to `SortAction`, it has a support count of 1 and a confidence level of 0.05, indicating a weak but existing relationship.\n\n11. **SelectAllAction**: Also appearing once during co-changes with a confidence level of 0.05, it may need to be reviewed for synchronization.\n\n12. **UnselectAll**: Another entity with a support count of 1 and a confidence level of 0.05, which could be impacted by changes in `TodoEditor.java`.\n\n13. **AbstractSettings**: This entity also shares a low support count of 1 and a confidence level of 0.05, so it should be considered for possible review.\n\n14. **DeleteCompletedAction**: Given its appearance in one out of eight co-changes, with a confidence level of 0.05, it might require a check for necessary adjustments.\n\n15. **Vars**: While having a low support count of 1 and a confidence level of 0.05, `Vars` was identified in the call graph and thus should be included for potential synchronization.\n\n16. **Reminder**: Appearing only once with a confidence level of 0.05, it's listed due to its presence in the co-change results.\n\n17. **InsertLinkAction**: Lastly, this entity also appeared once during co-changes with a confidence level of 0.05, making it a candidate for review based on the co-change analysis.\n\nIn summary, entities at the top of the list have stronger evidence supporting the need for synchronized changes with `TodoEditor.java`.

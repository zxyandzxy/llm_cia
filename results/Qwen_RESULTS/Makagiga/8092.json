Similar to MainWindow, this entity has been changed alongside WikiPanel twice out of its recorded modification history, indicating a potential need for synchronization.\n\n4. **WebBrowserTab**: Support: 2, Confidence: 0.4.

These lower confidence values suggest a weaker historical association with changes in WikiPanel. However, they should still be considered for potential synchronization due to their appearance in co-change patterns.\n\nPlease note that the actual necessity for synchronization depends on the specific nature of the changes made to WikiPanel and how those changes relate to each of these entities' roles within the system architecture.

Moreover, it has a high conceptual coupling probability (0.817), indicating that these two entities are closely related in terms of functionality. Therefore, changes in `TransitionPanel.java` are very likely to necessitate changes in `MoveTransition`.\n\n2. **FadeTransition**: Although its confidence score is lower (0.333), the coupling dependency between `TransitionPanel.java` and `FadeTransition` involves the invocation of its constructor. This indicates direct usage within `TransitionPanel.java`, making it necessary to consider `FadeTransition` for synchronization when modifying `TransitionPanel.java`.\n\n3. **Sidebar**: With a support count of 1 and a confidence level of 0.333, this entity has been changed alongside `TransitionPanel.java` in the past. However, there is no further information on specific dependencies. It is included as a precautionary measure due to historical co-change patterns.\n\n4. **NewFolderDialog**: Similar to Sidebar, this entity shares the same support count and confidence level. It's included based on co-change history but requires further investigation to determine the exact nature of its relationship with `TransitionPanel.java`.\n\n5. **Button**: Also having a support count of 1 and a confidence level of 0.333, Button is included in the change set primarily due to co-change patterns. Without additional dependency analysis, it remains a potential candidate for synchronization.\n\n6. **ImageView**: Like other entities with a single support count and confidence level of 0.333, ImageView is included in the change set based on historical co-changes. The need for synchronization should be confirmed through further analysis.\n\n7. **GhostFrame**: Finally, GhostFrame also appears in the co-change list with similar metrics. While it is less likely to require changes compared to higher-ranked entities, it is still part of the change set due to past modification patterns alongside `TransitionPanel.java`.\n\nIn summary, `MoveTransition` and `FadeTransition` are the primary candidates for synchronized modifications due to their strong coupling dependencies with `TransitionPanel.java`.

Moreover, it has a high conceptual coupling probability (0.817), indicating that these two entities are closely related in terms of functionality. Therefore, changes in `TransitionPanel.java` are very likely to necessitate changes in `MoveTransition`.\n\n2. **FadeTransition**: Although its confidence score is lower (0.333), the coupling dependency between `TransitionPanel.java` and `FadeTransition` involves the invocation of its constructor. This indicates direct usage within `TransitionPanel.java`, making it necessary to consider `FadeTransition` for synchronization when modifying `TransitionPanel.java`.\n\n3. **Sidebar**: With a support count of 1 and a confidence level of 0.333, this entity has been changed alongside `TransitionPanel.java` in the past. However, there is no further information on specific dependencies. It is included as a precautionary measure due to historical co-change patterns.\n\n4. **NewFolderDialog**: Similar to Sidebar, this entity shares the same support count and confidence level. It's included based on co-change history but requires further investigation to determine the exact nature of its relationship with `TransitionPanel.java`.\n\n5. **Button**: Also having a support count of 1 and a confidence level of 0.333, Button is included in the change set primarily due to co-change patterns. Without additional dependency analysis, it remains a potential candidate for synchronization.\n\n6. **ImageView**: Like other entities with a single support count and confidence level of 0.333, ImageView is included in the change set based on historical co-changes. The need for synchronization should be confirmed through further analysis.\n\n7. **GhostFrame**: Finally, GhostFrame also appears in the co-change list with similar metrics. While it is less likely to require changes compared to higher-ranked entities, it is still part of the change set due to past modification patterns alongside `TransitionPanel.java`.\n\nIn summary, `MoveTransition` and `FadeTransition` are the primary candidates for synchronized modifications due to their strong coupling dependencies with `TransitionPanel.java`.

This high degree of semantic similarity suggests that although there are no direct coupling dependencies or call graph relationships, these two entities likely share a similar purpose or context within the project. This explains why they tend to be changed together as indicated by the co-change analysis.\n\nBased on our analysis:\n- Co-change relationship indicates `InternetSearchPlugin.java` is often changed with `InternetSearchPanel.java`.\n- There are no direct coupling dependencies or call graph relationships.\n- Conceptual coupling shows a strong semantic relationship.\n\nTherefore, it is recommended to synchronize changes between `InternetSearchPanel.java` and `InternetSearchPlugin.java` due to their high semantic similarity and historical co-change patterns. \n\nSince I have used 5 out of 7 function calls, I could further investigate other entities with lower confidence scores from the co-change analysis if needed.

Although there are no coupling dependencies between them, the semantic overlap suggests that changes in `MHTMLViewer.java` may necessitate corresponding changes in `MTextPane`.\n\n2. **NotepadEditorDesigner**: This entity appeared in the co-change list with a confidence level of 0.5. However, there are no coupling dependencies or direct calls from `MHTMLViewer.java`. Its inclusion in the change set is based on historical co-change patterns.\n\n3. **StaticHTMLEditorKit**: Similar to `NotepadEditorDesigner`, it has a confidence level of 0.5 but lacks any coupling dependencies or direct calls from `MHTMLViewer.java`. It is included due to past co-change patterns.\n\n4. **MWebBrowserPanel**: Appeared once in the co-change history with `MHTMLViewer.java` and has a confidence level of 0.25. There's no evidence of direct interaction or coupling dependencies, so its necessity for synchronization is less certain.\n\n5. **FeedViewer**: Co-changed once with `MHTMLViewer.java` and has a confidence level of 0.25. No coupling dependencies were found, making its need for synchronization less likely but still worth considering.\n\n6. **MDisposable**: This entity is directly used by `MHTMLViewer.java` according to the call graph. However, it did not appear in the co-change list, suggesting that while it is functionally related, its need for synchronization might be less critical unless significant changes occur in the disposal logic.\n\n7. **AbstractMarkupBuilder**: Also directly used by `MHTMLViewer.java` as per the call graph. Like `MDisposable`, it was not present in the co-change list, indicating potential functional relevance but uncertain need for synchronization.\n\n8. **InvokedFromConstructor**: Directly used by `MHTMLViewer.java` without appearing in the co-change list. Its synchronization needs should be evaluated based on the specific functionality it provides.\n\n9. **TK**: Another entity directly used by `MHTMLViewer.java` that did not show up in the co-change list. Its importance for synchronization depends on the context of its usage.\n\n10. **MText**: Used directly by `MHTMLViewer.java` but absent from the co-change list. Synchronization requirements would depend on the nature of changes made.\n\n11. **PropertiesDialog**: Appeared once in the co-change history with a confidence level of 0.25. Without further evidence of dependency, its inclusion in the change set is speculative.\n\n12. **Content**: Similar to `PropertiesDialog`, it appeared once in the co-change list and has a confidence level of 0.25. The need for synchronization is uncertain without more information.\n\n13. **UpdateDialog**: Appeared once in the co-change history with a confidence level of 0.25. Its requirement for synchronization is less clear without additional context.\n\n14. **HTMLPreviewProvider**: Appeared once in the co-change list with a confidence level of 0.25. Its necessity for synchronization is also unclear.\n\n15. **FeedComponent**: Had the lowest support and confidence levels among all entities considered. Its inclusion in the change set is the least certain and would require strong justification for synchronization efforts.\n\nIn summary, while some entities like `MTextPane` have a clearer case for synchronization due to their direct use and semantic similarity, others such as `FeedComponent` have weaker cases based on the available data. Careful consideration should be given to the nature and extent of changes when deciding on synchronization efforts.",

Although there are no coupling dependencies between them, the semantic overlap suggests that changes in `MHTMLViewer.java` may necessitate corresponding changes in `MTextPane`.\n\n2. **NotepadEditorDesigner**: This entity appeared in the co-change list with a confidence level of 0.5. However, there are no coupling dependencies or direct calls from `MHTMLViewer.java`. Its inclusion in the change set is based on historical co-change patterns.\n\n3. **StaticHTMLEditorKit**: Similar to `NotepadEditorDesigner`, it has a confidence level of 0.5 but lacks any coupling dependencies or direct calls from `MHTMLViewer.java`. It is included due to past co-change patterns.\n\n4. **MWebBrowserPanel**: Appeared once in the co-change history with `MHTMLViewer.java` and has a confidence level of 0.25. There's no evidence of direct interaction or coupling dependencies, so its necessity for synchronization is less certain.\n\n5. **FeedViewer**: Co-changed once with `MHTMLViewer.java` and has a confidence level of 0.25. No coupling dependencies were found, making its need for synchronization less likely but still worth considering.\n\n6. **MDisposable**: This entity is directly used by `MHTMLViewer.java` according to the call graph. However, it did not appear in the co-change list, suggesting that while it is functionally related, its need for synchronization might be less critical unless significant changes occur in the disposal logic.\n\n7. **AbstractMarkupBuilder**: Also directly used by `MHTMLViewer.java` as per the call graph. Like `MDisposable`, it was not present in the co-change list, indicating potential functional relevance but uncertain need for synchronization.\n\n8. **InvokedFromConstructor**: Directly used by `MHTMLViewer.java` without appearing in the co-change list. Its synchronization needs should be evaluated based on the specific functionality it provides.\n\n9. **TK**: Another entity directly used by `MHTMLViewer.java` that did not show up in the co-change list. Its importance for synchronization depends on the context of its usage.\n\n10. **MText**: Used directly by `MHTMLViewer.java` but absent from the co-change list. Synchronization requirements would depend on the nature of changes made.\n\n11. **PropertiesDialog**: Appeared once in the co-change history with a confidence level of 0.25. Without further evidence of dependency, its inclusion in the change set is speculative.\n\n12. **Content**: Similar to `PropertiesDialog`, it appeared once in the co-change list and has a confidence level of 0.25. The need for synchronization is uncertain without more information.\n\n13. **UpdateDialog**: Appeared once in the co-change history with a confidence level of 0.25. Its requirement for synchronization is less clear without additional context.\n\n14. **HTMLPreviewProvider**: Appeared once in the co-change list with a confidence level of 0.25. Its necessity for synchronization is also unclear.\n\n15. **FeedComponent**: Had the lowest support and confidence levels among all entities considered. Its inclusion in the change set is the least certain and would require strong justification for synchronization efforts.\n\nIn summary, while some entities like `MTextPane` have a clearer case for synchronization due to their direct use and semantic similarity, others such as `FeedComponent` have weaker cases based on the available data. Careful consideration should be given to the nature and extent of changes when deciding on synchronization efforts.",

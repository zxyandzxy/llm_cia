The number of supports is 1 and the confidence is 1.0, indicating that every time `ProxyPanel.java` was modified, so was `ActionGroup`. Furthermore, it appears in the call graph of `ProxyPanel.java`, suggesting direct interaction between the two entities. Even though there are no coupling dependencies detected, their conceptual coupling score of 0.849501 signifies a significant semantic similarity. All these factors make `ActionGroup` highly likely to need synchronized modifications when changes occur in `ProxyPanel.java`.\n\n- **Table**: Although this entity showed up in the co-change relationship results with a support count of 1 and confidence of 1.0, further investigation revealed that `Table` has been removed from the project due to project version iteration. Therefore, despite the initial indication of needing synchronization, `Table` is no longer relevant for change impact analysis concerning `ProxyPanel.java`. However, it's included here for completeness based on the function result.\n\nPlease note that while `Table` is listed in the change set according to the function results, our detailed analysis suggests it should not be considered for actual synchronization due to its removal from the project.

The number of supports is 1 and the confidence is 1.0, indicating that every time `ProxyPanel.java` was modified, so was `ActionGroup`. Furthermore, it appears in the call graph of `ProxyPanel.java`, suggesting direct interaction between the two entities. Even though there are no coupling dependencies detected, their conceptual coupling score of 0.849501 signifies a significant semantic similarity. All these factors make `ActionGroup` highly likely to need synchronized modifications when changes occur in `ProxyPanel.java`.\n\n- **Table**: Although this entity showed up in the co-change relationship results with a support count of 1 and confidence of 1.0, further investigation revealed that `Table` has been removed from the project due to project version iteration. Therefore, despite the initial indication of needing synchronization, `Table` is no longer relevant for change impact analysis concerning `ProxyPanel.java`. However, it's included here for completeness based on the function result.\n\nPlease note that while `Table` is listed in the change set according to the function results, our detailed analysis suggests it should not be considered for actual synchronization due to its removal from the project. Thus, `ActionGroup` stands as the primary candidate for synchronized changes with `ProxyPanel.java`. \n\nThis concludes the analysis for the given starting entity `ProxyPanel.java`.

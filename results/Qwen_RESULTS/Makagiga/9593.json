Additionally, it has a relatively high conceptual coupling probability of 0.81814456, indicating a strong conceptual relationship between the two files. Although there are no direct coupling dependencies or calls, this strong conceptual relationship suggests that `MNotification` should be considered for synchronized changes.\n\n2. **ToggleButton**: Despite having the same support count and confidence level as `MNotification`, this entity is reported to have been removed from the project due to version iteration. Therefore, it is less relevant for synchronization but included here for completeness based on historical data.\n\n3. **MAction, MTextPane, Tree, TextEditor, MSmallColorButton, MSplitPane, MouseGestures, Widget2Help, MCalendarPanel, MStatusBar, Tabs, ScriptError, ColorPanel, StaticThrobber, StaticMouseHandler, StaticHighlighterHandler, MList, ColorComponent, ListActionsLayerUI**: These entities all have a lower support count of 1 and a confidence level of 0.25, which means they appeared only once out of four changes involving `MMouseAdapter.java`. While these entities have a weaker correlation than `MNotification` and `ToggleButton`, they still appear in the co-change history. However, since there was no evidence found of any direct coupling dependencies or calls, nor significant conceptual coupling, their need for synchronization is less certain compared to `MNotification`.\n\nIn conclusion, `MNotification` stands out as the most likely candidate for synchronized changes with `MMouseAdapter.java` due to both its co-change history and high conceptual similarity. The other entities listed have a lower likelihood of requiring synchronized changes, but they may still be worth reviewing depending on the nature of the changes being made to `MMouseAdapter.java`.",

Additionally, it has a relatively high conceptual coupling probability of 0.81814456, indicating a strong conceptual relationship between the two files. Although there are no direct coupling dependencies or calls, this strong conceptual relationship suggests that `MNotification` should be considered for synchronized changes.\n\n2. **ToggleButton**: Despite having the same support count and confidence level as `MNotification`, this entity is reported to have been removed from the project due to version iteration. Therefore, it is less relevant for synchronization but included here for completeness based on historical data.\n\n3. **MAction, MTextPane, Tree, TextEditor, MSmallColorButton, MSplitPane, MouseGestures, Widget2Help, MCalendarPanel, MStatusBar, Tabs, ScriptError, ColorPanel, StaticThrobber, StaticMouseHandler, StaticHighlighterHandler, MList, ColorComponent, ListActionsLayerUI**: These entities all have a lower support count of 1 and a confidence level of 0.25, which means they appeared only once out of four changes involving `MMouseAdapter.java`. While these entities have a weaker correlation than `MNotification` and `ToggleButton`, they still appear in the co-change history. However, since there was no evidence found of any direct coupling dependencies or calls, nor significant conceptual coupling, their need for synchronization is less certain compared to `MNotification`.\n\nIn conclusion, `MNotification` stands out as the most likely candidate for synchronized changes with `MMouseAdapter.java` due to both its co-change history and high conceptual similarity. The other entities listed have a lower likelihood of requiring synchronized changes, but they may still be worth reviewing depending on the nature of the changes being made to `MMouseAdapter.java`.",

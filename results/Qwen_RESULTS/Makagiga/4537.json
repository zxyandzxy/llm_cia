Although both `TextEditorPlugin.java` and `TodoEditorPlugin.java` have been changed alongside `LinkEditorPlugin.java` in the past, `TextEditorPlugin.java` shows a stronger case for being affected due to its higher co-change confidence and significant semantic similarity.\n\nTherefore, when planning to make changes to `LinkEditorPlugin.java`, you should consider reviewing and potentially updating `TextEditorPlugin.java` as well.

However, since there is no direct coupling dependency or known semantic similarity, the need for synchronization changes is less certain compared to `TextEditorPlugin.java`.

Although both `TextEditorPlugin.java` and `TodoEditorPlugin.java` have been changed alongside `LinkEditorPlugin.java` in the past, `TextEditorPlugin.java` shows a stronger case for being affected due to its higher co-change confidence and significant semantic similarity.\n\nTherefore, when planning to make changes to `LinkEditorPlugin.java`, you should consider reviewing and potentially updating `TextEditorPlugin.java` as well.

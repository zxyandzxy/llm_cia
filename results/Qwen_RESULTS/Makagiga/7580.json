Although there are no direct coupling dependencies between them, the conceptual coupling is quite high (approximately 0.852), indicating that they share a significant semantic similarity. Therefore, it's likely that changes to `FormPanel.java` will also affect `MLoginPanel.java`.\n\n2. `TextEditor.java`: This entity has co-changed with `FormPanel.java` twice, giving a confidence level of 0.25. There are no direct coupling dependencies found, but considering the co-change frequency, it may still need to be reviewed for synchronization if changes to `FormPanel.java` involve broader feature modifications.\n\n3. `ShowHTMLAction.java`: Similar to `TextEditor.java`, this entity has also been modified alongside `FormPanel.java` two times with a confidence of 0.25. It does not have any direct coupling dependencies with `FormPanel.java`, but its repeated appearance in change history suggests potential indirect dependencies or shared functionality.\n\n4. `ImportExport.java`: The entity appears in the co-change list with `FormPanel.java` twice and holds a confidence level of 0.25. Without direct coupling dependencies, it might be involved in feature-related changes rather than structural ones. Hence, it should be considered for synchronization depending on the context of the change.\n\n5. `MMessage.java`: This entity has been modified once when `FormPanel.java` was changed, resulting in a lower confidence level of 0.125. While the co-change occurrence is less frequent compared to others, it could still be relevant in specific scenarios where related features are being updated.\n\nIn conclusion, `MLoginPanel.java` stands out as the primary candidate for synchronization due to its high co-change frequency and strong conceptual coupling with `FormPanel.java`. Other entities listed in the change set should be evaluated based on the nature and scope of the proposed changes to `FormPanel.java`.",

Although there are no direct coupling dependencies between them, the conceptual coupling is quite high (approximately 0.852), indicating that they share a significant semantic similarity. Therefore, it's likely that changes to `FormPanel.java` will also affect `MLoginPanel.java`.\n\n2. `TextEditor.java`: This entity has co-changed with `FormPanel.java` twice, giving a confidence level of 0.25. There are no direct coupling dependencies found, but considering the co-change frequency, it may still need to be reviewed for synchronization if changes to `FormPanel.java` involve broader feature modifications.\n\n3. `ShowHTMLAction.java`: Similar to `TextEditor.java`, this entity has also been modified alongside `FormPanel.java` two times with a confidence of 0.25. It does not have any direct coupling dependencies with `FormPanel.java`, but its repeated appearance in change history suggests potential indirect dependencies or shared functionality.\n\n4. `ImportExport.java`: The entity appears in the co-change list with `FormPanel.java` twice and holds a confidence level of 0.25. Without direct coupling dependencies, it might be involved in feature-related changes rather than structural ones. Hence, it should be considered for synchronization depending on the context of the change.\n\n5. `MMessage.java`: This entity has been modified once when `FormPanel.java` was changed, resulting in a lower confidence level of 0.125. While the co-change occurrence is less frequent compared to others, it could still be relevant in specific scenarios where related features are being updated.\n\nIn conclusion, `MLoginPanel.java` stands out as the primary candidate for synchronization due to its high co-change frequency and strong conceptual coupling with `FormPanel.java`. Other entities listed in the change set should be evaluated based on the nature and scope of the proposed changes to `FormPanel.java`.",

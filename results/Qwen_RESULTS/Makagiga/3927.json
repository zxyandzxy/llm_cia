In order to help solve the CIA mission, you should first understand some necessary concepts\uff1a\n(1)entity: Entities represent source code files in CIA tasks, and all the CIA tasks under study are based on the Java language, so entities are files with the .java extension.\n(2)starting entity: The starting entity is also called salient entity, and the salient entity is the root change that causes the modification of the rest of entities in a change set, while the rest of entities are the dependency modification along with the salient one.\nYou will be presented with a starting entity and tools (functions) will be provided to access the more information of the origin system. Your task is to gradually explain which entity really need to be synchronized, based on the starting entity and the information obtained through the function-call. You have 7 chances to call the function to get more information."

This indicates that changes to `NoteWidget.java` may require corresponding changes to `MTextArea.java` due to their close functional and semantic relationship.\n\n2. **MApplication**: Similar to `MTextArea`, it shares a strong conceptual relationship with a semantic similarity probability of 0.848. As a core component, changes in `NoteWidget.java` might affect `MApplication.java`.\n\n3. **CalendarWidget**: Although there are no coupling dependencies between `NoteWidget.java` and `CalendarWidget.java`, they have co-changed twice with a confidence level of 0.4, making it the highest among entities that have been modified alongside `NoteWidget.java`. This suggests a higher chance of needing synchronization during modifications.\n\n4. **PrintAction, ChartDialog, DefaultPreview, ConfigureAction, ConsoleConfig, DeskletLoader, SummaryRenderer, StatsDialog, NoteWidgetPlugin, GeneralSettings, MCalendar, ScriptIDE**: These entities appear in the list of co-change relationships but with only one support and a lower confidence level of 0.2.

As a core component, changes in `NoteWidget.java` might affect `MApplication.java`.\n\n3. **CalendarWidget**: Although there are no coupling dependencies between `NoteWidget.java` and `CalendarWidget.java`, they have co-changed twice with a confidence level of 0.4, making it the highest among entities that have been modified alongside `NoteWidget.java`.

In order to help solve the CIA mission, you should first understand some necessary concepts\uff1a\n(1)entity: Entities represent source code files in CIA tasks, and all the CIA tasks under study are based on the Java language, so entities are files with the .java extension.\n(2)starting entity: The starting entity is also called salient entity, and the salient entity is the root change that causes the modification of the rest of entities in a change set, while the rest of entities are the dependency modification along with the salient one.\nYou will be presented with a starting entity and tools (functions) will be provided to access the more information of the origin system. Your task is to gradually explain which entity really need to be synchronized, based on the starting entity and the information obtained through the function-call. You have 7 chances to call the function to get more information."

Additionally, it shares a high conceptual similarity probability of approximately 0.7845, which further strengthens the need for synchronization.\n\n2. **SearchFS.java**: Although there are no direct coupling dependencies between `FSProperties.java` and `SearchFS.java`, they share a high conceptual similarity probability of approximately 0.7924. The co-change analysis also shows a confidence of 0.5 and supports of 2, suggesting that changes in `FSProperties.java` often coincide with changes in `SearchFS.java`.\n\n3. **FeedsFS.java**: Similar to `SearchFS.java`, there are no direct coupling dependencies between `FeedsFS.java` and `FSProperties.java`. However, their conceptual similarity is relatively high at approximately 0.7343, and they have been changed together twice out of four modifications of `FSProperties.java`, with a confidence level of 0.5.\n\n4. **CustomGeneralPanel.java**: With a lower confidence level of 0.25 and only one support, this entity is less likely to require synchronization compared to the top three.

Additionally, it shares a high conceptual similarity probability of approximately 0.7845, which further strengthens the need for synchronization.\n\n2. **SearchFS.java**: Although there are no direct coupling dependencies between `FSProperties.java` and `SearchFS.java`, they share a high conceptual similarity probability of approximately 0.7924. The co-change analysis also shows a confidence of 0.5 and supports of 2, suggesting that changes in `FSProperties.java` often coincide with changes in `SearchFS.java`.\n\n3. **FeedsFS.java**: Similar to `SearchFS.java`, there are no direct coupling dependencies between `FeedsFS.java` and `FSProperties.java`. However, their conceptual similarity is relatively high at approximately 0.7343, and they have been changed together twice out of four modifications of `FSProperties.java`, with a confidence level of 0.5.\n\n4. **CustomGeneralPanel.java**: With a lower confidence level of 0.25 and only one support, this entity is less likely to require synchronization compared to the top three.

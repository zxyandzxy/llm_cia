It also has a high semantic similarity probability of approximately 0.851 with `TextUtils.java`. Given these factors, it is highly likely that changes to `TextUtils.java` would necessitate corresponding changes in `NotepadEditor`.\n\n2. **FeedViewer, EditorSearch, TaskTable, StaticHighlighterHandler, AbstractTextEditor, WebBrowserEditor, NotepadEditorDesigner, NonePreview, StaticHandler, Core, CodePreviewProvider**: Each of these entities has appeared once alongside `TextUtils.java` during past code modifications (support = 1), with a confidence level of 0.25. Although they have lower support and confidence than NotepadEditor, their association with `TextUtils.java` suggests they may need to be considered for synchronization if there are changes affecting shared functionalities or features.\n\n3. **MMenu, TodoEditor, EditorQuickFind, TextEditor**: These entities similarly have appeared once alongside `TextUtils.java` (support = 1) with a confidence level of 0.25. They are listed last as they share the same confidence level but were less frequently changed with `TextUtils.java` compared to others.\n\nIn conclusion, while `NotepadEditor` stands out as the most likely candidate for synchronized changes due to its higher support and confidence levels along with significant conceptual coupling, the rest of the entities should also be monitored for potential ripple effects from changes made to `TextUtils.java`.

Given these factors, it is highly likely that changes to `TextUtils.java` would necessitate corresponding changes in `NotepadEditor`.\n\n2. **FeedViewer, EditorSearch, TaskTable, StaticHighlighterHandler, AbstractTextEditor, WebBrowserEditor, NotepadEditorDesigner, NonePreview, StaticHandler, Core, CodePreviewProvider**: Each of these entities has appeared once alongside `TextUtils.java` during past code modifications (support = 1), with a confidence level of 0.25. Although they have lower support and confidence than NotepadEditor, their association with `TextUtils.java` suggests they may need to be considered for synchronization if there are changes affecting shared functionalities or features.\n\n3. **MMenu, TodoEditor, EditorQuickFind, TextEditor**: These entities similarly have appeared once alongside `TextUtils.java` (support = 1) with a confidence level of 0.25. They are listed last as they share the same confidence level but were less frequently changed with `TextUtils.java` compared to others.\n\nIn conclusion, while `NotepadEditor` stands out as the most likely candidate for synchronized changes due to its higher support and confidence levels along with significant conceptual coupling, the rest of the entities should also be monitored for potential ripple effects from changes made to `TextUtils.java`.

This indicates that both entities likely interact closely within the application context, suggesting a need for synchronization when changes occur.\n\n3. **AbstractPreview**: As part of the inheritance hierarchy or interface implementations involving preview functionalities, it could be directly impacted by changes in `DefaultPreview.java`.\n\n4. **LinkEditorPlugin**: Since this plugin might use or extend preview functionalities, it could require updates if the core preview behavior is altered.\n\n5. **TodoEditorPlugin**: Similar to `LinkEditorPlugin`, this editor plugin may depend on the preview functionality provided by `DefaultPreview.java`.\n\n6. **TreeSettings**: Changes in preview-related features could impact settings that govern how previews are displayed or managed within the application.\n\n7. **Editor**: The editor component may rely on the preview functionality for rendering content, thus requiring updates when preview behavior changes.\n\n8. **NotepadEditor**: If the notepad editor uses the preview feature, it might need to adapt to changes made in `DefaultPreview.java`.\n\n9. **NotepadEditorPlugin**: Like `NotepadEditor`, the plugin might also depend on the preview's correct functioning.\n\n10. **ScriptError**: Errors related to scripting might involve previews, so any change affecting previews could influence how script errors are handled.\n\n11. **ProxyManager**: If proxies affect preview operations, changes here might necessitate adjustments in `DefaultPreview.java`.\n\n12. **DesktopPanel**: This panel might integrate previews, making it sensitive to changes in the preview logic.\n\n13. **BackgroundTaskManager**: If background tasks are used for preview generation or loading, then coordination with `DefaultPreview.java` is essential.\n\n14. **Preview**: Being central to the preview system, any core changes will have ripple effects on this entity.\n\n15. **FSHelper**: File system interactions required by previews might need adjustments following changes in preview functionality.\n\n16. **EditorCrypto**: If encryption or decryption processes are involved in preview handling, `EditorCrypto` would need to synchronize with `DefaultPreview.java`.\n\nEach of these entities has shown historical co-change patterns with `DefaultPreview.java`, indicating that they should be considered for synchronized modifications when changes are made to `DefaultPreview.java`.

This suggests that changes in one might imply necessary changes in the other due to their conceptual relationship.\n\n2. **PreviewPanel**: It has been co-changed with `DefaultPreview.java` in the past, and the call graph shows an overlap in some common references such as `MProperties`, `UI`, and `MLogger`. This indicates that both entities likely interact closely within the application context, suggesting a need for synchronization when changes occur.\n\n3. **AbstractPreview**: As part of the inheritance hierarchy or interface implementations involving preview functionalities, it could be directly impacted by changes in `DefaultPreview.java`.\n\n4. **LinkEditorPlugin**: Since this plugin might use or extend preview functionalities, it could require updates if the core preview behavior is altered.\n\n5. **TodoEditorPlugin**: Similar to `LinkEditorPlugin`, this editor plugin may depend on the preview functionality provided by `DefaultPreview.java`.\n\n6. **TreeSettings**: Changes in preview-related features could impact settings that govern how previews are displayed or managed within the application.\n\n7. **Editor**: The editor component may rely on the preview functionality for rendering content, thus requiring updates when preview behavior changes.\n\n8. **NotepadEditor**: If the notepad editor uses the preview feature, it might need to adapt to changes made in `DefaultPreview.java`.\n\n9. **NotepadEditorPlugin**: Like `NotepadEditor`, the plugin might also depend on the preview's correct functioning.\n\n10. **ScriptError**: Errors related to scripting might involve previews, so any change affecting previews could influence how script errors are handled.\n\n11. **ProxyManager**: If proxies affect preview operations, changes here might necessitate adjustments in `DefaultPreview.java`.\n\n12. **DesktopPanel**: This panel might integrate previews, making it sensitive to changes in the preview logic.\n\n13. **BackgroundTaskManager**: If background tasks are used for preview generation or loading, then coordination with `DefaultPreview.java` is essential.\n\n14. **Preview**: Being central to the preview system, any core changes will have ripple effects on this entity.\n\n15. **FSHelper**: File system interactions required by previews might need adjustments following changes in preview functionality.\n\n16. **EditorCrypto**: If encryption or decryption processes are involved in preview handling, `EditorCrypto` would need to synchronize with `DefaultPreview.java`.\n\nEach of these entities has shown historical co-change patterns with `DefaultPreview.java`, indicating that they should be considered for synchronized modifications when changes are made to `DefaultPreview.java`.

However, without a strong dependency, the need for synchronization is less clear compared to `DocumentLinks`.\n\nTo summarize, based on the performed analyses:\n\n1. **Primary Entity to Synchronize:** `DocumentLinks` - It has a direct `Instanceof(IO)` coupling dependency with `Links.java` and a high conceptual coupling score, indicating a close semantic relationship.\n2. **Secondary Consideration:** `MLinkAction` - Although there are no direct coupling dependencies, it is frequently called by `Links.java` and thus might require review during any changes.\n\nOther entities such as `RemoveAllLinksAction` and `Submenu` had slightly higher co-change frequencies but did not show significant coupling or call relationships.

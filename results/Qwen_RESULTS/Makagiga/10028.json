Your task is to gradually explain which entity really need to be synchronized, based on the starting entity and the information obtained through the function-call.

Any changes to `Plugin.java` that affect these interactions will likely require corresponding changes in `PluginInfo.java`.\n\n2. **WidgetPlugin.java**: Although there are no explicit code-level dependencies found between `Plugin.java` and `WidgetPlugin.java`, they share a strong conceptual coupling (0.804). This high semantic similarity suggests that they often change together due to their related functionality within the project.\n\n3. **PluginManager.java**: Despite having no direct coupling dependencies, `PluginManager.java` shares a significant conceptual coupling (0.725) with `Plugin.java`. They have been modified together multiple times in the past, suggesting that changes in one might necessitate changes in the other.\n\n4. **Main.java**: It has moderate support (3) and confidence (0.3) in co-change relationships with `Plugin.java`, indicating some historical correlation that justifies its inclusion in the synchronization effort.\n\n5. **ImageEditorCore.java**: With support (2) and confidence (0.2), this entity is less likely to need synchronization compared to the top candidates but still shows a pattern of co-changes with `Plugin.java`.\n\n6. **Sidebar.java**: Similar to `ImageEditorCore.java`, it has lower support and confidence scores but appears in the co-change history with `Plugin.java`.\n\n7. **MainWindow.java**: Also with support (2) and confidence (0.2), it's included in the list based on the co-change relationship.\n\n8. **TriBoolean, Obsolete, MAccessController, FS, Config, DesignPattern, MIcon, MArrayList, MMainWindow, MLogger, TK**: These entities are directly used by `Plugin.java` according to the call graph analysis. Changes in `Plugin.java` may impact how these entities are used or interacted with, thus requiring a review for potential modifications.\n\nPlease note that while the last group of entities is listed alphabetically rather than by their likelihood of needing changes, all should be reviewed during any modification to `Plugin.java` due to their direct usage.

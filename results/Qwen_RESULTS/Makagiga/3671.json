Additionally, the conceptual coupling probability of 0.832 indicates a high semantic similarity, further justifying the need to synchronize changes between these two files.\n\n2. **MFontChooser** and **MIconChooser**: Both entities have been changed together with `MList.java` four times, and both have the same confidence level of 0.182. They also share a relatively high conceptual coupling with `MList.java`, although we don't have the exact values from the provided information. These similarities suggest that changes to `MList.java` may require corresponding adjustments in `MFontChooser` and `MIconChooser`.\n\n3. **InternetSearch** and **FilterDialog**: Each of these entities shares five co-changes with `MList.java`, resulting in a confidence level of 0.227. This indicates that they have been modified concurrently more than average, suggesting a moderate need for synchronization when changes occur in `MList.java`.\n\n4. **PluginSettings**, **QuickOpen**, and **MComboBox**: These entities each have three co-changes with `MList.java` and a confidence level of 0.136. Although less frequent compared to the previous entities, the repeated pattern of concurrent changes implies some form of dependency or related functionality that warrants consideration during modifications.\n\n5. **VersionPanel** and **StaticHandler**: These entities have been involved in two co-change events with `MList.java`, giving them a lower confidence level of 0.091. While their likelihood of requiring synchronized changes is not as high as others, it is still notable enough to consider reviewing these files when `MList.java` undergoes changes.\n\nOverall, while there are no direct call graph dependencies or coupling dependencies found between `MList.java` and other entities, the patterns identified through co-change relationships and conceptual coupling provide valuable insights into which entities are likely to require synchronized changes.",

Additionally, the conceptual coupling probability of 0.832 indicates a high semantic similarity, further justifying the need to synchronize changes between these two files.\n\n2. **MFontChooser** and **MIconChooser**: Both entities have been changed together with `MList.java` four times, and both have the same confidence level of 0.182. They also share a relatively high conceptual coupling with `MList.java`, although we don't have the exact values from the provided information. These similarities suggest that changes to `MList.java` may require corresponding adjustments in `MFontChooser` and `MIconChooser`.\n\n3. **InternetSearch** and **FilterDialog**: Each of these entities shares five co-changes with `MList.java`, resulting in a confidence level of 0.227. This indicates that they have been modified concurrently more than average, suggesting a moderate need for synchronization when changes occur in `MList.java`.\n\n4. **PluginSettings**, **QuickOpen**, and **MComboBox**: These entities each have three co-changes with `MList.java` and a confidence level of 0.136. Although less frequent compared to the previous entities, the repeated pattern of concurrent changes implies some form of dependency or related functionality that warrants consideration during modifications.\n\n5. **VersionPanel** and **StaticHandler**: These entities have been involved in two co-change events with `MList.java`, giving them a lower confidence level of 0.091. While their likelihood of requiring synchronized changes is not as high as others, it is still notable enough to consider reviewing these files when `MList.java` undergoes changes.\n\nOverall, while there are no direct call graph dependencies or coupling dependencies found between `MList.java` and other entities, the patterns identified through co-change relationships and conceptual coupling provide valuable insights into which entities are likely to require synchronized changes.",

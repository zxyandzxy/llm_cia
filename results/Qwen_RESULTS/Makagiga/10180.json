Although there are no direct coupling dependencies, it has a high conceptual similarity probability (approximately 0.838), indicating that changes to `ColorPalette.java` likely require corresponding changes to `MSmallColorChooser.java` due to their shared functionality or purpose.\n\n2. **MColorPicker.java**: Co-changed 4 times with `ColorPalette.java`, with a confidence level of approximately 0.67. Despite the lack of direct coupling dependencies, its frequent co-change history suggests a strong association with `ColorPalette.java`. Changes may need to be synchronized if they affect similar aspects of the application's color-related features.\n\n3. **Button.java**, **DefaultColorPalette.java**, **ApplicationPalette.java**, **Web20Palette.java**: Each of these entities was co-changed 2 times with `ColorPalette.java`, with a confidence level of approximately 0.33. The lower confidence levels indicate less certainty about the need for synchronized changes, but given the moderate support, these entities should still be considered when making significant changes to `ColorPalette.java`.\n\n4. **MColorIcon.java**, **ColorHistory.java**: These entities have the lowest support and confidence levels among the listed entities, being co-changed only once with `ColorPalette.java`. Their inclusion is based on the assumption that even a single co-change can be indicative of some form of relationship, although the need for synchronization is less critical compared to the higher-ranked entities.\n\nIn conclusion, while direct code interdependencies were not found, the analysis of co-change relationships and conceptual coupling provides valuable insight into which entities are likely to be affected by changes to `ColorPalette.java`. Entities like `MSmallColorChooser.java` and `MColorPicker.java` should be prioritized for synchronized modifications, followed by consideration of the other entities as needed based on the nature and extent of the changes being made.",

Although there are no direct coupling dependencies, it has a high conceptual similarity probability (approximately 0.838), indicating that changes to `ColorPalette.java` likely require corresponding changes to `MSmallColorChooser.java` due to their shared functionality or purpose.\n\n2. **MColorPicker.java**: Co-changed 4 times with `ColorPalette.java`, with a confidence level of approximately 0.67. Despite the lack of direct coupling dependencies, its frequent co-change history suggests a strong association with `ColorPalette.java`. Changes may need to be synchronized if they affect similar aspects of the application's color-related features.\n\n3. **Button.java**, **DefaultColorPalette.java**, **ApplicationPalette.java**, **Web20Palette.java**: Each of these entities was co-changed 2 times with `ColorPalette.java`, with a confidence level of approximately 0.33. The lower confidence levels indicate less certainty about the need for synchronized changes, but given the moderate support, these entities should still be considered when making significant changes to `ColorPalette.java`.\n\n4. **MColorIcon.java**, **ColorHistory.java**: These entities have the lowest support and confidence levels among the listed entities, being co-changed only once with `ColorPalette.java`. Their inclusion is based on the assumption that even a single co-change can be indicative of some form of relationship, although the need for synchronization is less critical compared to the higher-ranked entities.\n\nIn conclusion, while direct code interdependencies were not found, the analysis of co-change relationships and conceptual coupling provides valuable insight into which entities are likely to be affected by changes to `ColorPalette.java`. Entities like `MSmallColorChooser.java` and `MColorPicker.java` should be prioritized for synchronized modifications, followed by consideration of the other entities as needed based on the nature and extent of the changes being made.",

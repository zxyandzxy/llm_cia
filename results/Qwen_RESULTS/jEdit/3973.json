This will help maintain consistency and avoid potential issues arising from their close relationship in the jEdit project.

Additionally, there is a high conceptual coupling between the two files, as indicated by the semantic similarity probability of approximately 0.855. Although no direct coupling dependencies exist, their shared functional concepts suggest that changes to `ExtensionManager.java` are likely to necessitate corresponding changes in `TextAreaPainter.java`.\n\n- **Gutter.java**: Similarly, this entity also shows a significant co-change relationship with `ExtensionManager.java`, supported by 2 instances of concurrent modifications and a perfect confidence level (support/confidence = 2/2 = 1.0). The conceptual coupling between `ExtensionManager.java` and `Gutter.java` is nearly as strong, with a semantic similarity probability of around 0.853.

Additionally, there is a high conceptual coupling between the two files, as indicated by the semantic similarity probability of approximately 0.855.

The conceptual coupling between `ExtensionManager.java` and `Gutter.java` is nearly as strong, with a semantic similarity probability of around 0.853.

The lack of direct coupling or call graph evidence does not negate the fact that it shared a significant co-change relationship with `FirstLine.java`.\n\nWhile both entities have an equal number of supports and confidence, they are listed in the order they were discovered.

The lack of direct coupling or call graph evidence does not negate the fact that it shared a significant co-change relationship with `FirstLine.java`.\n\nWhile both entities have an equal number of supports and confidence, they are listed in the order they were discovered.

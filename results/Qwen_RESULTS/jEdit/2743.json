Additionally, it shares a relatively high conceptual similarity, suggesting they are involved in similar or closely related functionalities within the system.\n\n2. **FloatingWindowContainer** - Support: 9, Confidence: 0.36, Conceptual Coupling: 0.69079727\n   Similar to PanelWindowContainer, FloatingWindowContainer has a significant co-change relationship with DockableWindowManager.java. It also shows a slightly higher conceptual coupling, further supporting the need for synchronization when changes occur.\n\n3. **ButtonLayout** - Support: 8, Confidence: 0.32\n   With a high support count and moderate confidence, ButtonLayout often changes alongside DockableWindowManager.java. Although no direct coupling dependencies were found, its frequent co-changes suggest it may be part of the same module or feature area requiring updates together.\n\n4. **Entry** - Support: 6, Confidence: 0.24 (Appears twice in the results)\n   Entry appears twice in the co-change results, highlighting its potential relevance. Its co-change frequency suggests it might interact with DockableWindowManager.java in ways that necessitate concurrent modifications.\n\n5. **MouseHandler** - Support: 6, Confidence: 0.24\n   MouseHandler has a support count of 6, indicating it is frequently modified alongside DockableWindowManager.java. This could imply shared functionality or interaction patterns within the user interface components.\n\n6. **DockingOptionPane** - Support: 3, Confidence: 0.12\n   DockingOptionPane has a lower but still notable support count. Given its relation to docking options and configurations, it's plausible that changes in window management might require adjustments here as well.\n\n7. **ActionBar** - Support: 4, Confidence: 0.16\n   ActionBar has a moderate support count, and its presence in the change set implies it could be related to actions or behaviors influenced by changes in DockableWindowManager.java.\n\n8. **KeyHandler** - Support: 2, Confidence: 0.08\n   While having a lower support count, KeyHandler's inclusion is due to its role in handling key events, which might correlate with changes affecting window management and docking behaviors.\n\n9. **ResizeMouseHandler** - Support: 1, Confidence: 0.04\n   Although having the lowest support count, ResizeMouseHandler's involvement in resizing operations makes it relevant for consideration in the context of dockable windows.\n\nEach of these entities should be considered for synchronization with DockableWindowManager.java based on their historical co-change relationships and functional interdependencies inferred through conceptual coupling.

Additionally, it shares a relatively high conceptual similarity, suggesting they are involved in similar or closely related functionalities within the system.\n\n2. **FloatingWindowContainer** - Support: 9, Confidence: 0.36, Conceptual Coupling: 0.69079727\n   Similar to PanelWindowContainer, FloatingWindowContainer has a significant co-change relationship with DockableWindowManager.java. It also shows a slightly higher conceptual coupling, further supporting the need for synchronization when changes occur.\n\n3. **ButtonLayout** - Support: 8, Confidence: 0.32\n   With a high support count and moderate confidence, ButtonLayout often changes alongside DockableWindowManager.java. Although no direct coupling dependencies were found, its frequent co-changes suggest it may be part of the same module or feature area requiring updates together.\n\n4. **Entry** - Support: 6, Confidence: 0.24 (Appears twice in the results)\n   Entry appears twice in the co-change results, highlighting its potential relevance. Its co-change frequency suggests it might interact with DockableWindowManager.java in ways that necessitate concurrent modifications.\n\n5. **MouseHandler** - Support: 6, Confidence: 0.24\n   MouseHandler has a support count of 6, indicating it is frequently modified alongside DockableWindowManager.java. This could imply shared functionality or interaction patterns within the user interface components.\n\n6. **DockingOptionPane** - Support: 3, Confidence: 0.12\n   DockingOptionPane has a lower but still notable support count. Given its relation to docking options and configurations, it's plausible that changes in window management might require adjustments here as well.\n\n7. **ActionBar** - Support: 4, Confidence: 0.16\n   ActionBar has a moderate support count, and its presence in the change set implies it could be related to actions or behaviors influenced by changes in DockableWindowManager.java.\n\n8. **KeyHandler** - Support: 2, Confidence: 0.08\n   While having a lower support count, KeyHandler's inclusion is due to its role in handling key events, which might correlate with changes affecting window management and docking behaviors.\n\n9. **ResizeMouseHandler** - Support: 1, Confidence: 0.04\n   Although having the lowest support count, ResizeMouseHandler's involvement in resizing operations makes it relevant for consideration in the context of dockable windows.\n\nEach of these entities should be considered for synchronization with DockableWindowManager.java based on their historical co-change relationships and functional interdependencies inferred through conceptual coupling.

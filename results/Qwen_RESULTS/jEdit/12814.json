Furthermore, it has a high conceptual coupling score of 0.86750656, indicating a strong semantic similarity and shared functionality or context. Therefore, changes to `EditPane.java` are likely to necessitate corresponding changes in `SelectionManager.java`.\n\n- **PaintLineBackground.java**: Although this file has been removed from the project's current iteration, it appeared in 2 out of 5 modifications alongside `EditPane.java` (confidence of 0.4). However, since it is no longer part of the project, it should not be considered for synchronization anymore.\n\n- **JEditTextArea.java**: This file is directly referenced by `EditPane.java` as indicated by the call graph analysis. Since there is a direct usage relationship between these two files, any changes made to `EditPane.java` may impact `JEditTextArea.java`, making it necessary to synchronize them.\n\n- **Gutter.java**: Similar to `JEditTextArea.java`, `Gutter.java` is also directly referenced by `EditPane.java`. Changes to `EditPane.java` could potentially affect `Gutter.java`, so they should be synchronized.\n\n- **BufferSetManager.java**: It appears once in the co-change list with `EditPane.java` (support of 1 and confidence of 0.2). While the confidence is lower compared to others, its appearance in the co-change list suggests that it might need to be checked for synchronization when modifying `EditPane.java`.\n\n- **BufferSetWidget.java**: Like `BufferSetManager.java`, it also appears once in the co-change list with `EditPane.java` (support of 1 and confidence of 0.2). Due to the low confidence, it should be considered but ranked lower in priority.\n\n- **PanelWindowContainer.java**: This file also appears once in the co-change list with `EditPane.java` (support of 1 and confidence of 0.2). Given the low support and confidence, it is included in the change set but ranks lower in terms of likelihood for needing synchronized changes.\n\nThe elements in the Change set are sorted in descending order of the likelihood of synchronized modifications based on co-change frequency, confidence, direct usage (call graph), and conceptual coupling. The top priority goes to those entities that have both high co-change frequency/confidence and direct relationships with `EditPane.java`. Entities with lower confidence or without direct usage are ranked accordingly. \n\nPlease note that while the original function result included more entities, only the ones with higher relevance were selected for the final change set, excluding `PaintLineBackground.java` due to its removal from the project.",

Furthermore, it has a high conceptual coupling score of 0.86750656, indicating a strong semantic similarity and shared functionality or context. Therefore, changes to `EditPane.java` are likely to necessitate corresponding changes in `SelectionManager.java`.\n\n- **PaintLineBackground.java**: Although this file has been removed from the project's current iteration, it appeared in 2 out of 5 modifications alongside `EditPane.java` (confidence of 0.4). However, since it is no longer part of the project, it should not be considered for synchronization anymore.\n\n- **JEditTextArea.java**: This file is directly referenced by `EditPane.java` as indicated by the call graph analysis. Since there is a direct usage relationship between these two files, any changes made to `EditPane.java` may impact `JEditTextArea.java`, making it necessary to synchronize them.\n\n- **Gutter.java**: Similar to `JEditTextArea.java`, `Gutter.java` is also directly referenced by `EditPane.java`. Changes to `EditPane.java` could potentially affect `Gutter.java`, so they should be synchronized.\n\n- **BufferSetManager.java**: It appears once in the co-change list with `EditPane.java` (support of 1 and confidence of 0.2). While the confidence is lower compared to others, its appearance in the co-change list suggests that it might need to be checked for synchronization when modifying `EditPane.java`.\n\n- **BufferSetWidget.java**: Like `BufferSetManager.java`, it also appears once in the co-change list with `EditPane.java` (support of 1 and confidence of 0.2). Due to the low confidence, it should be considered but ranked lower in priority.\n\n- **PanelWindowContainer.java**: This file also appears once in the co-change list with `EditPane.java` (support of 1 and confidence of 0.2). Given the low support and confidence, it is included in the change set but ranks lower in terms of likelihood for needing synchronized changes.\n\nThe elements in the Change set are sorted in descending order of the likelihood of synchronized modifications based on co-change frequency, confidence, direct usage (call graph), and conceptual coupling. The top priority goes to those entities that have both high co-change frequency/confidence and direct relationships with `EditPane.java`. Entities with lower confidence or without direct usage are ranked accordingly. \n\nPlease note that while the original function result included more entities, only the ones with higher relevance were selected for the final change set, excluding `PaintLineBackground.java` due to its removal from the project.",

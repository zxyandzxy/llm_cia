It is also directly called by `ModeProvider.java`, making it highly likely that changes in `ModeProvider.java` will require corresponding changes in `jEdit`.\n\n2. **Mode**: Similar to `jEdit`, this entity has a co-change relationship with `ModeProvider.java` with 1 support and a confidence level of 1.0. Additionally, it is used within `ModeProvider.java`, indicating a strong dependency and high likelihood of needing synchronized changes.\n\n3. **TextArea**: Co-changed with `ModeProvider.java` with 1 support and a confidence level of 1.0. Although not directly referenced in the call graph, its co-change history suggests that changes in `ModeProvider.java` may impact `TextArea`.\n\n4. **JEditBuffer**: Also co-changed with `ModeProvider.java` with 1 support and a confidence level of 1.0. The co-change relationship implies that changes in `ModeProvider.java` could necessitate changes in `JEditBuffer`.\n\n5. **ModeCatalogHandler**: Co-changed with `ModeProvider.java` with 1 support and a confidence level of 1.0. Given its co-change history, it should be considered for synchronized modifications when `ModeProvider.java` changes.\n\n6. **JEditMode**: Another entity co-changed with `ModeProvider.java` with 1 support and a confidence level of 1.0. Its co-change relationship indicates that it should be monitored for necessary changes alongside `ModeProvider.java`.\n\n7. **GUIUtilities**: Directly interacts with `ModeProvider.java` as per the call graph and has a high conceptual coupling score (0.8438404). Although not identified through co-change analysis, its direct interaction and semantic similarity suggest it might need to synchronize changes.\n\n8. **Log**: Called by `ModeProvider.java` and has a high conceptual coupling score (0.8483011). While it wasn't part of the co-change analysis, its usage and semantic relation imply potential need for synchronized changes.\n\n9. **IOUtilities**: Interacts with `ModeProvider.java` and has a high conceptual coupling score (0.82877934).

It's also worth noting the other entities with a confidence level above 0.67 (`PluginManager`, `KeyHandler`, `Occur`, `HyperSearchRequest`, `PositionManager`, `ActionHandler`, and `Debug`) as they might require attention during changes, even though they do not have an explicit or conceptual coupling with `HyperSearchResult.java`.\n\nGiven our findings and having used up several function calls already, it would be prudent to stop here for now. If further investigation into any specific entity is required, we can revisit the analysis with additional function calls.\n\nTo summarize, based on the co-change analysis and conceptual coupling, `HyperSearchResults` is the primary entity that needs to be synchronized with `HyperSearchResult.java`.

This suggests that although there are no explicit coupling dependencies, these two entities share a significant amount of semantic content, which likely leads to them being modified together.\n\nWith this information, we can conclude that `HyperSearchResults` should be synchronized when changes are made to `HyperSearchResult.java`, due to their strong conceptual relationship. It's also worth noting the other entities with a confidence level above 0.67 (`PluginManager`, `KeyHandler`, `Occur`, `HyperSearchRequest`, `PositionManager`, `ActionHandler`, and `Debug`) as they might require attention during changes, even though they do not have an explicit or conceptual coupling with `HyperSearchResult.java`.\n\nGiven our findings and having used up several function calls already, it would be prudent to stop here for now. If further investigation into any specific entity is required, we can revisit the analysis with additional function calls.\n\nTo summarize, based on the co-change analysis and conceptual coupling, `HyperSearchResults` is the primary entity that needs to be synchronized with `HyperSearchResult.java`.

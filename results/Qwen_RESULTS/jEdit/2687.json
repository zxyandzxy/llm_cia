In order to help solve the CIA mission, you should first understand some necessary concepts\uff1a\n(1)entity: Entities represent source code files in CIA tasks, and all the CIA tasks under study are based on the Java language, so entities are files with the .java extension.\n(2)starting entity: The starting entity is also called salient entity, and the salient entity is the root change that causes the modification of the rest of entities in a change set, while the rest of entities are the dependency modification along with the salient one.\nYou will be presented with a starting entity and tools (functions) will be provided to access the more information of the origin system. Your task is to gradually explain which entity really need to be synchronized, based on the starting entity and the information obtained through the function-call. You have 7 chances to call the function to get more information."

Additionally, it shares a high conceptual coupling probability of `0.8492152`. The combination of these factors strongly suggests that changes to `InstallThread.java` are likely to necessitate corresponding modifications in `SwingInstall.java`.\n\n2. **TextAreaPainter.java**: Although there is no direct coupling dependency or call graph relationship between `TextAreaPainter.java` and `InstallThread.java`, they share a significant co-change relationship, also supported by 2 instances with full confidence (1.0). Furthermore, their conceptual coupling probability is quite high at `0.820537`, indicating that these files may be semantically related and thus should be considered for synchronized changes.\n\n3. **NonInteractiveInstall.java**: This entity has been changed alongside `InstallThread.java` twice as well, with full confidence (1.0). However, the conceptual coupling between `InstallThread.java` and `NonInteractiveInstall.java` is `0.0`, which indicates no semantic similarity.

In order to help solve the CIA mission, you should first understand some necessary concepts\uff1a\n(1)entity: Entities represent source code files in CIA tasks, and all the CIA tasks under study are based on the Java language, so entities are files with the .java extension.\n(2)starting entity: The starting entity is also called salient entity, and the salient entity is the root change that causes the modification of the rest of entities in a change set, while the rest of entities are the dependency modification along with the salient one.\nYou will be presented with a starting entity and tools (functions) will be provided to access the more information of the origin system. Your task is to gradually explain which entity really need to be synchronized, based on the starting entity and the information obtained through the function-call. You have 7 chances to call the function to get more information."

Furthermore, their conceptual coupling probability is quite high at `0.820537`, indicating that these files may be semantically related and thus should be considered for synchronized changes.\n\n3. **NonInteractiveInstall.java**: This entity has been changed alongside `InstallThread.java` twice as well, with full confidence (1.0).

Your task is to gradually explain which entity really need to be synchronized, based on the starting entity and the information obtained through the function-call.

The removal means it's less relevant for current change impact analysis, but its historical co-change relationship indicates that at some point in the project lifecycle, these two entities were closely related. Thus, if any residual references exist in older branches or legacy systems, it might be worth considering during synchronization.\n\n3. **ErrorsOptionPane**: Similar to \"ViewOptionPane\", this entity was also co-changed with \"GeneralOptionPane.java\" once, but it has since been removed from the project.

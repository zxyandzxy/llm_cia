This indicates that even though `ChunkCache.java` makes calls to `Buffer`, they do not share any of the typical code coupling relationships such as inheritance, implementing interfaces, using return types, or throwing exceptions.\n\nSince there is no direct coupling dependency between `ChunkCache.java` and `Buffer.java`, and given the high conceptual similarity between `ChunkCache.java` and `JEditTextArea.java`, it appears that `JEditTextArea.java` is the primary entity that should be synchronized with changes to `ChunkCache.java`.\n\nGiven our findings and the fact that we have exhausted our chances to call more functions, we can conclude that:\n\n- `JEditTextArea.java` is strongly recommended to be updated in synchronization with `ChunkCache.java` due to its high co-change support count, confidence level, and semantic similarity.\n- Other entities listed in the co-change results also have a relationship with `ChunkCache.java`, but they are less significant. If time and resources allow, it might be beneficial to review these files (`MarkerHighlight.java`, `TextAreaPainter.java`, etc.) for possible updates, but they are not as critical as `JEditTextArea.java`.\n\nTherefore, the main entity that really needs to be synchronized with `ChunkCache.java` is `JEditTextArea.java`.",

Although their confidence levels are not as high as `JEditTextArea.java`, these entities have been historically modified alongside `ChunkCache.java`. Therefore, there is still a likelihood that changes to `ChunkCache.java` may require corresponding changes in these files.

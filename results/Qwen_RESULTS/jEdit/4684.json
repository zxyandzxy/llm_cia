In order to help solve the CIA mission, you should first understand some necessary concepts\uff1a\n(1)entity: Entities represent source code files in CIA tasks, and all the CIA tasks under study are based on the Java language, so entities are files with the .java extension.\n(2)starting entity: The starting entity is also called salient entity, and the salient entity is the root change that causes the modification of the rest of entities in a change set, while the rest of entities are the dependency modification along with the salient one.\nYou will be presented with a starting entity and tools (functions) will be provided to access the more information of the origin system. Your task is to gradually explain which entity really need to be synchronized, based on the starting entity and the information obtained through the function-call.

We have identified strong conceptual couplings between `SimpleNode.java` and some of its co-changed entities, such as `Parser.java` (semantic similarity of 0.693) and `Primitive.java` (semantic similarity of 0.769).\n\nConsidering these results, it's evident that while there might not be explicit code-level interactions, the high conceptual coupling implies that these files are likely part of a closely related set of functionalities within the project. Thus, they should be reviewed together when changes occur in `SimpleNode.java`.\n\nWith the remaining function calls, we could continue checking other co-changed entities for their conceptual coupling with `SimpleNode.java`, but given the strong relationships already identified, it's likely that most of the initially listed co-changed entities will exhibit similar patterns.\n\nTherefore, based on this analysis, you should consider synchronizing `SimpleNode.java` with other entities that show strong conceptual coupling, especially those like `Parser.java` and `Primitive.java`.

Although there are no direct coupling dependencies or call graph connections between them, they have a strong conceptual relationship with a semantic similarity probability of approximately 0.854. Therefore, it is highly likely that changes to `ParserRuleSet.java` will require changes to `TokenMarker.java`.\n\n2. **`XModeHandler.java`**: It appeared 5 times out of 8 modifications of `ParserRuleSet.java`, giving it a confidence level of 0.625. While we do not have detailed dependency information, its frequent co-changes suggest a potential indirect dependency that may necessitate synchronization.\n\n3. **`ParserRule.java`**: With 4 appearances and a confidence of 0.5, this entity shows moderate evidence of needing updates alongside `ParserRuleSet.java`. There could be shared functionality or design patterns influencing these changes.\n\n4. **`LineContext.java`**: Appeared 3 times during the modification of `ParserRuleSet.java`, with a confidence of 0.375. Its lower support indicates a less certain relationship but still suggests some degree of relatedness that might warrant attention during changes.\n\n5. **`TagDecl.java`**, **`SyntaxTokenUtilities.java`**, and **`Code2HTMLPlugin.java`**: Each of these entities appeared only once during the modification of `ParserRuleSet.java`, with confidences of 0.125. These low supports indicate weaker relationships, but their presence in the co-change list still hints at possible indirect interactions or common use cases that could benefit from synchronized changes.\n\nIn summary, based on historical co-change patterns and conceptual coupling, the change set should prioritize `TokenMarker.java` for synchronization due to its high confidence and semantic similarity with `ParserRuleSet.java`. Other entities should be considered as secondary candidates depending on the nature of the changes being made to `ParserRuleSet.java`.",

Although there are no direct coupling dependencies or call graph connections between them, they have a strong conceptual relationship with a semantic similarity probability of approximately 0.854. Therefore, it is highly likely that changes to `ParserRuleSet.java` will require changes to `TokenMarker.java`.\n\n2. **`XModeHandler.java`**: It appeared 5 times out of 8 modifications of `ParserRuleSet.java`, giving it a confidence level of 0.625. While we do not have detailed dependency information, its frequent co-changes suggest a potential indirect dependency that may necessitate synchronization.\n\n3. **`ParserRule.java`**: With 4 appearances and a confidence of 0.5, this entity shows moderate evidence of needing updates alongside `ParserRuleSet.java`. There could be shared functionality or design patterns influencing these changes.\n\n4. **`LineContext.java`**: Appeared 3 times during the modification of `ParserRuleSet.java`, with a confidence of 0.375. Its lower support indicates a less certain relationship but still suggests some degree of relatedness that might warrant attention during changes.\n\n5. **`TagDecl.java`**, **`SyntaxTokenUtilities.java`**, and **`Code2HTMLPlugin.java`**: Each of these entities appeared only once during the modification of `ParserRuleSet.java`, with confidences of 0.125. These low supports indicate weaker relationships, but their presence in the co-change list still hints at possible indirect interactions or common use cases that could benefit from synchronized changes.\n\nIn summary, based on historical co-change patterns and conceptual coupling, the change set should prioritize `TokenMarker.java` for synchronization due to its high confidence and semantic similarity with `ParserRuleSet.java`. Other entities should be considered as secondary candidates depending on the nature of the changes being made to `ParserRuleSet.java`.",

Although there are no direct coupling dependencies between these two entities, their conceptual coupling is quite high (similarity probability = 0.8132), indicating they might serve related functionality or be part of common feature changes within the jEdit project.\n\n2. **EnhancedCheckBoxMenuItem**: Similar to \"EnhancedMenuItem.java\", \"EnhancedCheckBoxMenuItem.java\" has been changed alongside \"OperatingSystem.java\" with the same frequency and confidence (support count = 2, confidence = 1.0).

Your task is to gradually explain which entity really need to be synchronized, based on the starting entity and the information obtained through the function-call.

Since `PatternSearchMatcher` extends `SearchMatcher`, any changes to the parent class can have a direct impact on the child class. Therefore, it is highly likely that modifications to `SearchMatcher.java` will necessitate corresponding changes in `PatternSearchMatcher`.\n\n2. **SearchAndReplace** (support: 1, confidence: 1.0)\n   - Although there are no direct coupling dependencies, the conceptual coupling between `SearchMatcher.java` and `SearchAndReplace` is relatively strong, with a semantic similarity probability of approximately 0.743. This suggests that both files share common functionality or concepts within the codebase, making it likely that they would be modified together during refactoring or feature enhancements.\n\n3. **HyperSearchRequest** (support: 1, confidence: 1.0)\n   - There are no direct coupling dependencies found between `SearchMatcher.java` and `HyperSearchRequest`. The co-change relationship might be due to indirect dependencies or project-specific patterns not identified through the available analysis functions. While the past change history indicates these two entities have been changed together, the lack of explicit evidence for dependency means it is less certain whether `HyperSearchRequest` needs to be synchronized with changes to `SearchMatcher.java`.

Since `PatternSearchMatcher` extends `SearchMatcher`, any changes to the parent class can have a direct impact on the child class. Therefore, it is highly likely that modifications to `SearchMatcher.java` will necessitate corresponding changes in `PatternSearchMatcher`.\n\n2. **SearchAndReplace** (support: 1, confidence: 1.0)\n   - Although there are no direct coupling dependencies, the conceptual coupling between `SearchMatcher.java` and `SearchAndReplace` is relatively strong, with a semantic similarity probability of approximately 0.743. This suggests that both files share common functionality or concepts within the codebase, making it likely that they would be modified together during refactoring or feature enhancements.\n\n3. **HyperSearchRequest** (support: 1, confidence: 1.0)\n   - There are no direct coupling dependencies found between `SearchMatcher.java` and `HyperSearchRequest`. The co-change relationship might be due to indirect dependencies or project-specific patterns not identified through the available analysis functions. While the past change history indicates these two entities have been changed together, the lack of explicit evidence for dependency means it is less certain whether `HyperSearchRequest` needs to be synchronized with changes to `SearchMatcher.java`.

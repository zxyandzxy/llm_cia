The order of entities listed reflects their potential direct interaction with `Type.java` based on common functionality and naming conventions. \n\nIt's important to note that without further analysis using functions such as `get_coupling_dependencies` or `get_call_graph`, the exact nature of these relationships remains speculative. Due to the constraint of function calls, I've provided a prioritized list based on the assumption that entities closely related to the core functionality of `Type.java` would appear earlier in the list.",

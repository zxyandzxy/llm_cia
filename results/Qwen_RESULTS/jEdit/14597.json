Moreover, the conceptual coupling probability of 0.710 indicates that these entities are still conceptually related, which justifies considering `BufferSet.java` for synchronized changes when `BufferSetListener.java` is updated.\n\n3. **Buffer**: The call graph analysis revealed that `BufferSetListener.java` directly interacts with an entity named `Buffer`. Since there is a method call or reference from `BufferSetListener.java` to `Buffer`, any modifications to `BufferSetListener.java` could impact the functionality associated with `Buffer`.

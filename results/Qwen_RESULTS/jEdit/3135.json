It is likely that changes in `Variable.java` will affect `Primitive.java` due to shared domain logic.\n   \n2. **EvalError.java**: Similar to `Primitive.java`, it has been co-changed 2 times with a confidence ratio of 1.0 but shows an even higher semantic similarity score of 0.836, making it highly probable that these two entities need to be modified together.\n\n3. **Types.java** to **ClassGeneratorImpl.java**: These entities have all been co-changed with `Variable.java` at least 2 times with a confidence ratio of 1.0. While we do not have specific conceptual coupling scores for each of them, the high co-change frequency suggests they should be included in the synchronization process. The order reflects the initial sorting from the co-change relationship function, assuming those appearing first might share stronger interdependencies or similarities not explicitly measured here.\n\nGiven the absence of direct call or coupling dependencies, the decision to include these entities in the change set is primarily driven by historical co-change patterns and the assumption that they share related functionality within the project's domain.

These files are likely to be affected by changes in `Variable.java` due to their shared domain logic, even if they do not directly interact at the code level.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the co-change analysis and the semantic similarities, you should consider synchronizing changes for at least `Primitive.java`, `EvalError.java`, and potentially other entities listed in the initial co-change result when you modify `Variable.java`.

While we do not have specific conceptual coupling scores for each of them, the high co-change frequency suggests they should be included in the synchronization process. The order reflects the initial sorting from the co-change relationship function, assuming those appearing first might share stronger interdependencies or similarities not explicitly measured here.\n\nGiven the absence of direct call or coupling dependencies, the decision to include these entities in the change set is primarily driven by historical co-change patterns and the assumption that they share related functionality within the project's domain.

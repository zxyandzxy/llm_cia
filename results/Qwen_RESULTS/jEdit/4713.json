However, it has been removed from the project, so despite its historical significance, it is not relevant for current synchronization needs.\n\n3. **BufferIORequest.java**: Changed 4 times alongside `DisplayManager.java` with a confidence level of 0.25. This indicates a moderate need for synchronized changes when `DisplayManager.java` is modified.\n\n4. **JEditTextArea.java**: It shares a high conceptual coupling probability of approximately 0.868 with `DisplayManager.java`. Given this strong semantic similarity, `JEditTextArea.java` is highly likely to need synchronization changes.\n\n5. **FirstLine.java**, **ScrollLineCount.java**: Both have been changed 6 times with a confidence level of 0.375. These entities might be related to similar functionalities or features as `DisplayManager.java` and should be considered for synchronized changes.\n\n6. **RingListModel.java**, **OffsetManager.java**, **PosBottomHalf.java**, **PositionManager.java**, **PasteFromListDialog.java**, **ListHandler.java**, **KeyHandler.java**, **FontSelector.java**, **FontSelectorDialog.java**, **TextAreaOptionPane.java**, **ActionHandler.java**: Each of these entities has been changed twice along with `DisplayManager.java` and has a confidence level of 0.125. While their co-change relationship is less strong compared to the above entities, they still indicate some level of dependency and should be monitored for potential required changes.\n\n7. **HelpIndex.java**, **HelpTOCPanel.java**, **View.java**: These entities also share a co-change relationship with `DisplayManager.java` with a confidence level of 0.125. They may be indirectly related through shared features or modules.\n\n8. **MouseHandler.java**, **Anchor.java**, **RangeMap.java**, **BeanShell.java**, **EditPane.java**, **TextAreaPainter.java**: With a confidence level of 0.0625 and having been changed once together with `DisplayManager.java`, these entities represent the lowest priority for synchronized changes but should still be noted due to past co-changes.\n\nThe elements in the Change set are sorted in descending order of the likelihood of synchronized modifications based on the number of supports and confidence levels from the co-change relationships, along with additional insights from the call graph and conceptual coupling.

However, it has been removed from the project, so despite its historical significance, it is not relevant for current synchronization needs.\n\n3. **BufferIORequest.java**: Changed 4 times alongside `DisplayManager.java` with a confidence level of 0.25. This indicates a moderate need for synchronized changes when `DisplayManager.java` is modified.\n\n4. **JEditTextArea.java**: It shares a high conceptual coupling probability of approximately 0.868 with `DisplayManager.java`. Given this strong semantic similarity, `JEditTextArea.java` is highly likely to need synchronization changes.\n\n5. **FirstLine.java**, **ScrollLineCount.java**: Both have been changed 6 times with a confidence level of 0.375. These entities might be related to similar functionalities or features as `DisplayManager.java` and should be considered for synchronized changes.\n\n6. **RingListModel.java**, **OffsetManager.java**, **PosBottomHalf.java**, **PositionManager.java**, **PasteFromListDialog.java**, **ListHandler.java**, **KeyHandler.java**, **FontSelector.java**, **FontSelectorDialog.java**, **TextAreaOptionPane.java**, **ActionHandler.java**: Each of these entities has been changed twice along with `DisplayManager.java` and has a confidence level of 0.125. While their co-change relationship is less strong compared to the above entities, they still indicate some level of dependency and should be monitored for potential required changes.\n\n7. **HelpIndex.java**, **HelpTOCPanel.java**, **View.java**: These entities also share a co-change relationship with `DisplayManager.java` with a confidence level of 0.125. They may be indirectly related through shared features or modules.\n\n8. **MouseHandler.java**, **Anchor.java**, **RangeMap.java**, **BeanShell.java**, **EditPane.java**, **TextAreaPainter.java**: With a confidence level of 0.0625 and having been changed once together with `DisplayManager.java`, these entities represent the lowest priority for synchronized changes but should still be noted due to past co-changes.\n\nThe elements in the Change set are sorted in descending order of the likelihood of synchronized modifications based on the number of supports and confidence levels from the co-change relationships, along with additional insights from the call graph and conceptual coupling.

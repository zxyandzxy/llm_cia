Additionally, it shares a relatively high conceptual coupling (0.67953545), indicating that they are conceptually related.\n\n2. **FloatingWindowContainer**: It shows a significant support of 9 with a confidence level of 0.36, suggesting it is often changed together with `DockableWindowManager.java`.\n\n3. **ButtonLayout**: This entity has been changed 8 times along with `DockableWindowManager.java`, giving it a confidence level of 0.32. Although there's no direct structural coupling, its frequent co-changes make it a candidate for synchronization.\n\n4. **Entry**: Co-changed 6 times with a confidence level of 0.24, this entity also indicates a potential need for synchronization.\n\n5. **MouseHandler**: Similar to `Entry`, it was co-changed 6 times with a confidence level of 0.24, which makes it another candidate for review when changes are made to `DockableWindowManager.java`.\n\n6. **DockablePanel**: Having a support count of 5 and a confidence level of 0.2, it suggests a moderate likelihood of needing updates when `DockableWindowManager.java` changes.\n\n7. **GlobalOptions**: With 4 supports and a confidence level of 0.16, it has a lower but still notable chance of requiring synchronization.\n\n8. **DockingOptionPane**: Shows 3 supports and a confidence of 0.12, making it less likely but still possible to require changes.\n\n9. **AppearanceOptionPane**, **ActionTextField**, **MenuMouseHandler**, **ResizeMouseHandler**, **DockableWindowFactory**, **ActionBar**, **KeyHandler**, **DocumentHandler**, **BufferChangeHandler**, **PluginJAR**, **ActionSet**, **SplashScreen**, **AboutDialog**: These entities have fewer supports and lower confidence levels but have appeared in the version history as being changed along with `DockableWindowManager.java`.

Although there's no direct structural coupling, its frequent co-changes make it a candidate for synchronization.\n\n4. **Entry**: Co-changed 6 times with a confidence level of 0.24, this entity also indicates a potential need for synchronization.\n\n5. **MouseHandler**: Similar to `Entry`, it was co-changed 6 times with a confidence level of 0.24, which makes it another candidate for review when changes are made to `DockableWindowManager.java`.\n\n6. **DockablePanel**: Having a support count of 5 and a confidence level of 0.2, it suggests a moderate likelihood of needing updates when `DockableWindowManager.java` changes.\n\n7. **GlobalOptions**: With 4 supports and a confidence level of 0.16, it has a lower but still notable chance of requiring synchronization.\n\n8. **DockingOptionPane**: Shows 3 supports and a confidence of 0.12, making it less likely but still possible to require changes.\n\n9. **AppearanceOptionPane**, **ActionTextField**, **MenuMouseHandler**, **ResizeMouseHandler**, **DockableWindowFactory**, **ActionBar**, **KeyHandler**, **DocumentHandler**, **BufferChangeHandler**, **PluginJAR**, **ActionSet**, **SplashScreen**, **AboutDialog**: These entities have fewer supports and lower confidence levels but have appeared in the version history as being changed along with `DockableWindowManager.java`.

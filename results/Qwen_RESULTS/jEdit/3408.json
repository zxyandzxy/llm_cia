With a confidence level of approximately 0.83, it is highly likely that changes to `HyperSearchOperationNode.java` would necessitate corresponding changes in `MouseHandler`. However, both entities have since been removed from the project.\n\n2. **HyperSearchFileNode**: Co-changed 4 out of 6 times with `HyperSearchOperationNode.java`, having a confidence of around 0.67. This indicates a moderate chance that changes in `HyperSearchOperationNode.java` would require adjustments in `HyperSearchFileNode`.

The lower confidence implies less certainty about whether changes to `HyperSearchOperationNode.java` would directly impact these entities. Nevertheless, they were considered for analysis due to their history of co-changes. \n\nIt's important to note that all entities listed above have been removed from the project. In previous versions, where these entities existed, changes to `HyperSearchOperationNode.java` might have required corresponding changes in any of the mentioned entities based on their co-change relationships.

With a confidence level of approximately 0.83, it is highly likely that changes to `HyperSearchOperationNode.java` would necessitate corresponding changes in `MouseHandler`. However, both entities have since been removed from the project.\n\n2. **HyperSearchFileNode**: Co-changed 4 out of 6 times with `HyperSearchOperationNode.java`, having a confidence of around 0.67. This indicates a moderate chance that changes in `HyperSearchOperationNode.java` would require adjustments in `HyperSearchFileNode`. But this entity has also been removed from the current version of the project.\n\n3. **HyperSearchRequest**: This entity appeared in 3 out of 6 modifications involving `HyperSearchOperationNode.java`, resulting in a confidence of 0.5. It suggests that there could be some dependency or interaction between these two files, but again, it's no longer relevant as the entity is not present in the latest project version.\n\nFor the remaining entities (ResultCellRenderer, HyperSearchFolderNode, HyperSearchTreeNodeCallback, NewSearchAction, TreeNodeCallbackAdapter, ExpandChildTreeNodesAction, CollapseChildTreeNodesAction, TreeDisplayAction, HyperSearchResult, and RemoveTreeNodeAction), each one has been co-changed 2 times along with `HyperSearchOperationNode.java`, yielding a lower confidence level of 0.33. The lower confidence implies less certainty about whether changes to `HyperSearchOperationNode.java` would directly impact these entities. Nevertheless, they were considered for analysis due to their history of co-changes. \n\nIt's important to note that all entities listed above have been removed from the project. In previous versions, where these entities existed, changes to `HyperSearchOperationNode.java` might have required corresponding changes in any of the mentioned entities based on their co-change relationships.

This means that whenever `VFSDirectoryEntryTable.java` was changed, these files were also changed around 57% of the time. These two seem highly relevant due to their relatively high confidence.\n\n2. **VFSDirectoryEntryTableModel**\n   - It has a support count of 2 and a confidence of approximately 0.29. Given its name similarity and direct relationship with `VFSDirectoryEntryTable.java`, it might be worth investigating further despite lower confidence compared to the first two.\n\nAmong these, `BrowserView` and `FileCellRenderer` stand out as they have the highest confidence rate. However, considering the nature of software systems where changes can ripple through closely related modules, we should also consider `VFSDirectoryEntryTableModel` because it seems to share a similar functionality or is part of the same module.\n\nNext, I will use the `get_call_graph` function on `VFSDirectoryEntryTable.java` to see if there are any direct method calls or variable references that could suggest which entities are used by our starting entity.

The conceptual coupling analysis further supports this, showing a semantic similarity probability of 0.8626. Changes in `VFSDirectoryEntryTable.java` are very likely to necessitate changes in `BrowserView`.\n\n2. **FileCellRenderer**: Similarly to `BrowserView`, it has a high support count of 4 and confidence of approximately 0.57.

They appear less frequently in co-changes but still show some degree of historical co-modification with `VFSDirectoryEntryTable.java`. Given their lower confidence levels compared to the top two entities, they are ranked lower in the change set. However, since they do share some history of being modified together, they should not be entirely overlooked during a code modification.\n\n5. **VFSPathSelected**: Lastly, this entity appears only once in the co-change history of `VFSDirectoryEntryTable.java` with the lowest confidence of approximately 0.14.

This means that whenever `VFSDirectoryEntryTable.java` was changed, these files were also changed around 57% of the time. These two seem highly relevant due to their relatively high confidence.\n\n2. **VFSDirectoryEntryTableModel**\n   - It has a support count of 2 and a confidence of approximately 0.29. Given its name similarity and direct relationship with `VFSDirectoryEntryTable.java`, it might be worth investigating further despite lower confidence compared to the first two.\n\nAmong these, `BrowserView` and `FileCellRenderer` stand out as they have the highest confidence rate. However, considering the nature of software systems where changes can ripple through closely related modules, we should also consider `VFSDirectoryEntryTableModel` because it seems to share a similar functionality or is part of the same module.\n\nNext, I will use the `get_call_graph` function on `VFSDirectoryEntryTable.java` to see if there are any direct method calls or variable references that could suggest which entities are used by our starting entity.

The conceptual coupling analysis further supports this, showing a semantic similarity probability of 0.8626.

They appear less frequently in co-changes but still show some degree of historical co-modification with `VFSDirectoryEntryTable.java`. Given their lower confidence levels compared to the top two entities, they are ranked lower in the change set.

Thus, it does not require synchronization.\n  \n- **SourceTree.java**: Similar to `SideKickTree.java`, this entity also had a high confidence level of co-change but has since been removed from the project and hence does not need to be synchronized.\n  \n- **SideKickOptionPane.java**: Again, although it showed strong co-change correlation with `MouseHandler.java`, this entity too has been removed as part of the project's evolution and doesn't need any synchronization efforts.\n\nIn summary, while the initial co-change relationship suggested that `SideKickTree.java`, `SourceTree.java`, and `SideKickOptionPane.java` might need to be synchronized with changes to `MouseHandler.java`, further investigation revealed that all these entities have been removed from the latest version of the jEdit project.

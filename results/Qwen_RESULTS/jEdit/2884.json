Your task is to gradually explain which entity really need to be synchronized, based on the starting entity and the information obtained through the function-call.

There are no direct coupling dependencies between `SimpleNode.java` and `Parser.java`.\n3. However, there is a significant co-change relationship and a moderate conceptual relationship between them.\n\nGiven these results, it seems that changes to `SimpleNode.java` should prompt a review of `Parser.java` and potentially other files that have shown a strong co-change relationship in the past. Although there are no explicit code-level connections, the historical data and conceptual similarity suggest that they may be conceptually related and thus require synchronization during modifications.\n\nConsidering we have used 4 out of 7 chances for function calls, I will now proceed to check one more entity from the co-change list using the `get_coupling_dependencies` function to see if there are any direct dependencies with another file.

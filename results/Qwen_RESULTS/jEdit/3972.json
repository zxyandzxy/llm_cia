This suggests that changes to `TextAreaPainter.java` might require changes to `EditPane` due to their historical relationship.\n  \n- **TextUtilities**: Similar to `EditPane`, `TextUtilities` has no direct coupling dependencies with `TextAreaPainter.java`. However, it appeared alongside `TextAreaPainter.java` in modifications 6 times with a confidence of 27.27%, indicating a potential need for synchronized changes based on historical patterns.\n\n- **ChunkCache**: Despite the lack of direct coupling dependencies, `ChunkCache` was also frequently changed along with `TextAreaPainter.java` (6 times) with a confidence of 27.27%. It should be considered for synchronization due to its common occurrence in past changes.\n\n- **Buffer**: The call graph reveals that `Buffer` is directly referenced by `TextAreaPainter.java`. Therefore, any change in `TextAreaPainter.java` that affects how it interacts with `Buffer` will necessitate corresponding modifications in `Buffer`.\n\n- **Log**: Like `Buffer`, `Log` is also directly called by `TextAreaPainter.java`. Changes in logging behavior or requirements within `TextAreaPainter.java` would likely impact `Log`, making it essential to synchronize modifications between these two entities.\n\nThe elements in the Change set are sorted in descending order of the likelihood of synchronized modifications, taking into account both the co-change frequency and confidence levels as well as direct references through the call graph.

This suggests that changes to `TextAreaPainter.java` might require changes to `EditPane` due to their historical relationship.\n  \n- **TextUtilities**: Similar to `EditPane`, `TextUtilities` has no direct coupling dependencies with `TextAreaPainter.java`. However, it appeared alongside `TextAreaPainter.java` in modifications 6 times with a confidence of 27.27%, indicating a potential need for synchronized changes based on historical patterns.\n\n- **ChunkCache**: Despite the lack of direct coupling dependencies, `ChunkCache` was also frequently changed along with `TextAreaPainter.java` (6 times) with a confidence of 27.27%. It should be considered for synchronization due to its common occurrence in past changes.\n\n- **Buffer**: The call graph reveals that `Buffer` is directly referenced by `TextAreaPainter.java`. Therefore, any change in `TextAreaPainter.java` that affects how it interacts with `Buffer` will necessitate corresponding modifications in `Buffer`.\n\n- **Log**: Like `Buffer`, `Log` is also directly called by `TextAreaPainter.java`. Changes in logging behavior or requirements within `TextAreaPainter.java` would likely impact `Log`, making it essential to synchronize modifications between these two entities.\n\nThe elements in the Change set are sorted in descending order of the likelihood of synchronized modifications, taking into account both the co-change frequency and confidence levels as well as direct references through the call graph.

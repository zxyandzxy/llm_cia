Although there are no direct coupling dependencies between them, they have historically been modified together, suggesting that they may be part of the same feature or user workflow within the application.\n\n2. **RESearchMatcher**: It has 6 supports with a confidence of 0.1875 and a high conceptual coupling (semantic similarity probability of approximately 0.865) to `SearchAndReplace.java`. The strong semantic relationship implies that changes in `SearchAndReplace.java` are likely to necessitate corresponding changes in `RESearchMatcher.java`.\n\n3. **HyperSearchRequest**: Having 7 supports and a confidence of 0.21875, this entity is another candidate for synchronization. Its higher confidence compared to `BoyerMooreSearchMatcher` makes it more likely to require changes when `SearchAndReplace.java` changes.\n\n4. **BoyerMooreSearchMatcher**: With 5 supports and a confidence of 0.15625, this entity also shows a moderate correlation with `SearchAndReplace.java`. While not as strongly coupled conceptually or by support-confidence metrics as `RESearchMatcher`, it still shares a pattern of co-changes with `SearchAndReplace.java`.\n\n5. **View**: This entity appears in the co-change list with 4 supports and a confidence of 0.125. Although its confidence is lower than the previous entities, it has been changed alongside `SearchAndReplace.java` enough times to warrant consideration for synchronization. It's possible that `View` interacts with search functionality in a way that requires concurrent updates.\n\nIn conclusion, these five entities should be considered for synchronized modifications when making changes to `SearchAndReplace.java`, based on their historical co-change patterns and the strength of their relationships.",

The strong semantic relationship implies that changes in `SearchAndReplace.java` are likely to necessitate corresponding changes in `RESearchMatcher.java`.\n\n3. **HyperSearchRequest**: Having 7 supports and a confidence of 0.21875, this entity is another candidate for synchronization. Its higher confidence compared to `BoyerMooreSearchMatcher` makes it more likely to require changes when `SearchAndReplace.java` changes.\n\n4. **BoyerMooreSearchMatcher**: With 5 supports and a confidence of 0.15625, this entity also shows a moderate correlation with `SearchAndReplace.java`. While not as strongly coupled conceptually or by support-confidence metrics as `RESearchMatcher`, it still shares a pattern of co-changes with `SearchAndReplace.java`.\n\n5. **View**: This entity appears in the co-change list with 4 supports and a confidence of 0.125. Although its confidence is lower than the previous entities, it has been changed alongside `SearchAndReplace.java` enough times to warrant consideration for synchronization. It's possible that `View` interacts with search functionality in a way that requires concurrent updates.\n\nIn conclusion, these five entities should be considered for synchronized modifications when making changes to `SearchAndReplace.java`, based on their historical co-change patterns and the strength of their relationships.",

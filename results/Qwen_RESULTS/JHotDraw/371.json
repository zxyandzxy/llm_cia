In order to help solve the CIA mission, you should first understand some necessary concepts\uff1a\n(1)entity: Entities represent source code files in CIA tasks, and all the CIA tasks under study are based on the Java language, so entities are files with the .java extension.\n(2)starting entity: The starting entity is also called salient entity, and the salient entity is the root change that causes the modification of the rest of entities in a change set, while the rest of entities are the dependency modification along with the salient one.\nYou will be presented with a starting entity and tools (functions) will be provided to access the more information of the origin system. Your task is to gradually explain which entity really need to be synchronized, based on the starting entity and the information obtained through the function-call. You have 7 chances to call the function to get more information."

Given this perfect correlation, it's highly likely that any modifications to `DrawingPanel.java` will necessitate corresponding changes in `DrawApplet`.\n\n2. **DuplicateAction**: Although there are no direct coupling dependencies between `DrawingPanel.java` and `DuplicateAction`, the conceptual coupling score is 0.796, which is quite high. This suggests that they share a significant amount of semantic similarity and should be considered for synchronized changes.\n\n3. **ElbowLiner**: Similar to `DuplicateAction`, `ElbowLiner` does not have direct coupling dependencies with `DrawingPanel.java`. However, the conceptual coupling score is slightly lower at 0.778, still indicating a strong conceptual relationship and suggesting that these two files should be modified together.\n\n4. **TextCreationTool**, **TextAreaCreationTool**, **CreationTool**, **CurvedLiner**, **BezierTool**, **PasteAction**, **JPopupButton**, **SelectAllAction**, and **ConnectionTool** are all directly called by `DrawingPanel.java` as indicated by the call graph. While we did not explore the specific coupling dependencies or conceptual couplings for each of these entities due to limited function calls, their direct usage within `DrawingPanel.java` implies that changes in `DrawingPanel.java` could affect these tools and actions.\n\n5. **ArrowTip**: Like the other tools and actions listed above, `ArrowTip` is also directly called by `DrawingPanel.java`. Its inclusion in the change set is based on the same reasoning applied to the previous entities.\n\nThe elements in the Change set are sorted in descending order of the likelihood of synchronized modifications, with `DrawApplet` being the most likely candidate for synchronized changes due to its historical co-change pattern with `DrawingPanel.java`. The remaining entities are primarily ordered based on their conceptual coupling scores where available and their direct usage by `DrawingPanel.java`.

Its inclusion in the change set is based on the same reasoning applied to the previous entities.\n\nThe elements in the Change set are sorted in descending order of the likelihood of synchronized modifications, with `DrawApplet` being the most likely candidate for synchronized changes due to its historical co-change pattern with `DrawingPanel.java`.

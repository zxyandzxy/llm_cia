In order to help solve the CIA mission, you should first understand some necessary concepts\uff1a\n(1)entity: Entities represent source code files in CIA tasks, and all the CIA tasks under study are based on the Java language, so entities are files with the .java extension.\n(2)starting entity: The starting entity is also called salient entity, and the salient entity is the root change that causes the modification of the rest of entities in a change set, while the rest of entities are the dependency modification along with the salient one.\nYou will be presented with a starting entity and tools (functions) will be provided to access the more information of the origin system. Your task is to gradually explain which entity really need to be synchronized, based on the starting entity and the information obtained through the function-call.

This indicates a strong coupling dependency. Changes to `AbstractApplication.java` are likely to affect `AppletApplication` due to this direct inheritance.\n\n2. **OpenAction** (Supports: 1, Confidence: 0.333)\n   - Although there is a co-change history with `AbstractApplication.java`, it has been removed from the project due to version iteration. As such, it does not require synchronization anymore. However, given its historical co-change pattern, it was included in the initial list.\n\n3. **NewAction** (Supports: 1, Confidence: 0.333)\n   - Similar to `OpenAction`, `NewAction` has also been removed from the project and thus does not need synchronization. It's listed based on past co-change patterns.\n\n4. **AbstractSelectionAction** (Supports: 1, Confidence: 0.333)\n   - There are no coupling dependencies between `AbstractApplication.java` and `AbstractSelectionAction`. The co-change relationship may have been coincidental or context-specific. Therefore, changes to `AbstractApplication.java` are unlikely to necessitate changes to `AbstractSelectionAction`.\n\n5. **PropertyChangeEdit** (Supports: 1, Confidence: 0.333)\n   - There are no coupling dependencies between `AbstractApplication.java` and `PropertyChangeEdit`. Like `AbstractSelectionAction`, the co-change relationship might be incidental, and synchronization is probably unnecessary.\n\nIn summary, the elements in the Change set are sorted in descending order of the likelihood of synchronized modifications. `AppletApplication` stands out as the primary candidate for synchronization due to the direct inheritance relationship with `AbstractApplication.java`. The other entities either lack current relevance (`OpenAction`, `NewAction`) or show no coupling dependencies (`AbstractSelectionAction`, `PropertyChangeEdit`). Therefore, they are less likely to require changes when modifying `AbstractApplication.java`.",

This indicates a strong coupling dependency. Changes to `AbstractApplication.java` are likely to affect `AppletApplication` due to this direct inheritance.\n\n2. **OpenAction** (Supports: 1, Confidence: 0.333)\n   - Although there is a co-change history with `AbstractApplication.java`, it has been removed from the project due to version iteration. As such, it does not require synchronization anymore. However, given its historical co-change pattern, it was included in the initial list.\n\n3. **NewAction** (Supports: 1, Confidence: 0.333)\n   - Similar to `OpenAction`, `NewAction` has also been removed from the project and thus does not need synchronization. It's listed based on past co-change patterns.\n\n4. **AbstractSelectionAction** (Supports: 1, Confidence: 0.333)\n   - There are no coupling dependencies between `AbstractApplication.java` and `AbstractSelectionAction`. The co-change relationship may have been coincidental or context-specific. Therefore, changes to `AbstractApplication.java` are unlikely to necessitate changes to `AbstractSelectionAction`.\n\n5. **PropertyChangeEdit** (Supports: 1, Confidence: 0.333)\n   - There are no coupling dependencies between `AbstractApplication.java` and `PropertyChangeEdit`. Like `AbstractSelectionAction`, the co-change relationship might be incidental, and synchronization is probably unnecessary.\n\nIn summary, the elements in the Change set are sorted in descending order of the likelihood of synchronized modifications. `AppletApplication` stands out as the primary candidate for synchronization due to the direct inheritance relationship with `AbstractApplication.java`. The other entities either lack current relevance (`OpenAction`, `NewAction`) or show no coupling dependencies (`AbstractSelectionAction`, `PropertyChangeEdit`). Therefore, they are less likely to require changes when modifying `AbstractApplication.java`.",

This means that every time `NanoXMLDOMOutput.java` was modified, `Methods.java` was also changed.

This indicates that changes to `NanoXMLDOMOutput.java` might impact `Disposable.java` as well.

Your task is to gradually explain which entity really need to be synchronized, based on the starting entity and the information obtained through the function-call.

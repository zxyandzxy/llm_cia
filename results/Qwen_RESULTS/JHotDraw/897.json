Additionally, based on our previous findings from the co-change analysis, we should consider `BoundsInParentOutlineHandle`, `LineOutlineHandle`, `PointHandle`, `BoundsInLocalOutlineHandle`, `ConnectionPointHandle`, and `MoveHandle` for synchronization as well, due to their perfect co-change confidence levels.\n\nBefore finalizing our recommendations, let's do one more check using the `get_coupling_dependencies` function to see if there are any specific types of dependencies (like inheritance, interfaces, etc.) between `Handle.java` and `RotateHandle`.",

Therefore, they should be considered for synchronization when changes occur in `Handle.java`.\n- `Undoable` has been identified through call graph analysis as being directly used by `Handle.java`, so it may need to be synchronized as well.\n- Despite the lack of direct coupling dependencies, the semantic connection and co-change history suggest a need for careful consideration of changes among these entities.\n\nBased on this analysis, you should consider synchronizing changes across `Handle.java`, `RotateHandle`, `BoundsInParentOutlineHandle`, `LineOutlineHandle`, `PointHandle`, `BoundsInLocalOutlineHandle`, `ConnectionPointHandle`, `MoveHandle`, and `Undoable` to maintain consistency within the system.",

RotateHandle: This entity has a perfect co-change confidence level of 1.0 with `Handle.java`, and it also shows strong conceptual coupling (0.795). These factors indicate that changes to `Handle.java` are very likely to require corresponding changes in `RotateHandle`.\n\n2. BoundsInParentOutlineHandle, LineOutlineHandle, PointHandle, BoundsInLocalOutlineHandle, ConnectionPointHandle, MoveHandle: All these entities have been modified along with `Handle.java` every time in history (confidence level of 1.0), indicating a high likelihood of needing synchronization when there is a change in `Handle.java`. They should be considered for synchronization.\n\n3. SelectionTool: With a confidence level of 0.5, this entity has been changed half as often as `Handle.java` was modified. Although its conceptual coupling score is high (0.783), suggesting some functional or architectural relevance, it ranks lower than the entities with perfect co-change confidence.\n\n4. SouthEastHandle, WestHandle, NorthWestHandle, SouthHandle, SouthWestHandle, NorthEastHandle, NorthHandle, EastHandle: These entities appear less frequently during changes of `Handle.java` (confidence level of 0.5).

Undoable: This entity is directly used by `Handle.java` according to the call graph analysis. Changes in `Handle.java` could affect how `Undoable` is utilized, so it's essential to consider this entity for synchronization to maintain consistency.\n\nOverall, while all entities in the change set may require consideration during code modification, the prioritization reflects the strength of historical co-change patterns, the degree of conceptual similarity, and direct usage relationships.

Therefore, they should be considered for synchronization when changes occur in `Handle.java`.\n- `Undoable` has been identified through call graph analysis as being directly used by `Handle.java`, so it may need to be synchronized as well.\n- Despite the lack of direct coupling dependencies, the semantic connection and co-change history suggest a need for careful consideration of changes among these entities.\n\nBased on this analysis, you should consider synchronizing changes across `Handle.java`, `RotateHandle`, `BoundsInParentOutlineHandle`, `LineOutlineHandle`, `PointHandle`, `BoundsInLocalOutlineHandle`, `ConnectionPointHandle`, `MoveHandle`, and `Undoable` to maintain consistency within the system.",

RotateHandle: This entity has a perfect co-change confidence level of 1.0 with `Handle.java`, and it also shows strong conceptual coupling (0.795). These factors indicate that changes to `Handle.java` are very likely to require corresponding changes in `RotateHandle`.\n\n2.

They should be considered for synchronization.\n\n3. SelectionTool: With a confidence level of 0.5, this entity has been changed half as often as `Handle.java` was modified. Although its conceptual coupling score is high (0.783), suggesting some functional or architectural relevance, it ranks lower than the entities with perfect co-change confidence.\n\n4. SouthEastHandle, WestHandle, NorthWestHandle, SouthHandle, SouthWestHandle, NorthEastHandle, NorthHandle, EastHandle: These entities appear less frequently during changes of `Handle.java` (confidence level of 0.5). While they might need attention, their lower confidence levels place them lower in priority compared to those with stronger evidence of co-change.\n\n5. Undoable: This entity is directly used by `Handle.java` according to the call graph analysis. Changes in `Handle.java` could affect how `Undoable` is utilized, so it's essential to consider this entity for synchronization to maintain consistency.\n\nOverall, while all entities in the change set may require consideration during code modification, the prioritization reflects the strength of historical co-change patterns, the degree of conceptual similarity, and direct usage relationships.

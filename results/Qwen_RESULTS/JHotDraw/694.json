This means that every time `NanoXMLDOMInput.java` was changed in the past, `JavaxDOMInput.java` was also modified. Furthermore, the conceptual coupling between these two entities is very high at 0.892, indicating they share significant semantic similarity. Therefore, it is highly likely that changes to `NanoXMLDOMInput.java` will require corresponding changes in `JavaxDOMInput.java`.\n\n2. **JavaPrimitivesDOMFactory.java**: Similarly, this entity has been changed alongside `NanoXMLDOMInput.java`, with 1 support and a confidence level of 1.0. The conceptual coupling probability of 0.841 suggests that there is a strong semantic connection between `NanoXMLDOMInput.java` and `JavaPrimitivesDOMFactory.java`.

This means that every time `NanoXMLDOMInput.java` was changed in the past, `JavaxDOMInput.java` was also modified. Furthermore, the conceptual coupling between these two entities is very high at 0.892, indicating they share significant semantic similarity. Therefore, it is highly likely that changes to `NanoXMLDOMInput.java` will require corresponding changes in `JavaxDOMInput.java`.\n\n2. **JavaPrimitivesDOMFactory.java**: Similarly, this entity has been changed alongside `NanoXMLDOMInput.java`, with 1 support and a confidence level of 1.0. The conceptual coupling probability of 0.841 suggests that there is a strong semantic connection between `NanoXMLDOMInput.java` and `JavaPrimitivesDOMFactory.java`.

In order to help solve the CIA mission, you should first understand some necessary concepts\uff1a\n(1)entity: Entities represent source code files in CIA tasks, and all the CIA tasks under study are based on the Java language, so entities are files with the .java extension.\n(2)starting entity: The starting entity is also called salient entity, and the salient entity is the root change that causes the modification of the rest of entities in a change set, while the rest of entities are the dependency modification along with the salient one.\nYou will be presented with a starting entity and tools (functions) will be provided to access the more information of the origin system. Your task is to gradually explain which entity really need to be synchronized, based on the starting entity and the information obtained through the function-call. You have 7 chances to call the function to get more information."

Specifically, the method `figureRequestRemove` at line 74 and the method `figureChanged` at line 81 in `AbstractCompositeFigure.java` use instances of `FigureEvent` to call methods from the `FigureEvent` class. This indicates a direct interaction through Function Parameter Invoking Method (FPIM) coupling. Therefore, changes in `AbstractCompositeFigure.java` may require corresponding changes in `FigureEvent.java`, making it highly likely that these two files need to be synchronized.\n\n- **ChildHandler**: Although the `get_co_change_relationship` function suggested that `ChildHandler` has been changed along with `AbstractCompositeFigure.java` in the past, it was noted that `ChildHandler` has been removed from the project due to project version iteration. Thus, it is no longer relevant for change impact analysis in the current context and should not be considered for synchronization.\n\n- **ConnectorHandle.java**: The co-change relationship indicated that `ConnectorHandle.java` has been modified together with `AbstractCompositeFigure.java` in the past. However, upon checking the coupling dependencies using `get_coupling_dependencies`, it was found that there are no coupling dependencies between these two entities. Hence, while they have historically been modified together, this does not necessarily mean they need to be synchronized now.\n\n- **AbstractTransferable.java**: Similar to `ConnectorHandle.java`, the co-change relationship showed that `AbstractTransferable.java` was also modified alongside `AbstractCompositeFigure.java`. Yet, after analyzing the coupling dependencies, there were no coupling dependencies identified between these two entities. Therefore, like `ConnectorHandle.java`, `AbstractTransferable.java` does not appear to require synchronization based on the absence of coupling dependencies.\n\nThe elements in the Change set are sorted in descending order of the likelihood of synchronized modifications:\n\n1. **FigureEvent.java** - High likelihood of needing synchronization due to direct coupling dependencies.\n2. **ChildHandler** - No longer relevant as it has been removed from the project.\n3. **ConnectorHandle.java** - Low likelihood of needing synchronization as there are no coupling dependencies.\n4. **AbstractTransferable.java** - Low likelihood of needing synchronization as there are no coupling dependencies.\n\nIn summary, based on the provided functions and the results obtained, only `FigureEvent.java` shows a clear need for synchronization with `AbstractCompositeFigure.java` due to existing coupling dependencies.

Specifically, the method `figureRequestRemove` at line 74 and the method `figureChanged` at line 81 in `AbstractCompositeFigure.java` use instances of `FigureEvent` to call methods from the `FigureEvent` class. This indicates a direct interaction through Function Parameter Invoking Method (FPIM) coupling. Therefore, changes in `AbstractCompositeFigure.java` may require corresponding changes in `FigureEvent.java`, making it highly likely that these two files need to be synchronized.\n\n- **ChildHandler**: Although the `get_co_change_relationship` function suggested that `ChildHandler` has been changed along with `AbstractCompositeFigure.java` in the past, it was noted that `ChildHandler` has been removed from the project due to project version iteration. Thus, it is no longer relevant for change impact analysis in the current context and should not be considered for synchronization.\n\n- **ConnectorHandle.java**: The co-change relationship indicated that `ConnectorHandle.java` has been modified together with `AbstractCompositeFigure.java` in the past. However, upon checking the coupling dependencies using `get_coupling_dependencies`, it was found that there are no coupling dependencies between these two entities. Hence, while they have historically been modified together, this does not necessarily mean they need to be synchronized now.\n\n- **AbstractTransferable.java**: Similar to `ConnectorHandle.java`, the co-change relationship showed that `AbstractTransferable.java` was also modified alongside `AbstractCompositeFigure.java`. Yet, after analyzing the coupling dependencies, there were no coupling dependencies identified between these two entities. Therefore, like `ConnectorHandle.java`, `AbstractTransferable.java` does not appear to require synchronization based on the absence of coupling dependencies.\n\nThe elements in the Change set are sorted in descending order of the likelihood of synchronized modifications:\n\n1. **FigureEvent.java** - High likelihood of needing synchronization due to direct coupling dependencies.\n2. **ChildHandler** - No longer relevant as it has been removed from the project.\n3. **ConnectorHandle.java** - Low likelihood of needing synchronization as there are no coupling dependencies.\n4. **AbstractTransferable.java** - Low likelihood of needing synchronization as there are no coupling dependencies.\n\nIn summary, based on the provided functions and the results obtained, only `FigureEvent.java` shows a clear need for synchronization with `AbstractCompositeFigure.java` due to existing coupling dependencies.

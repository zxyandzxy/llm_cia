In order to help solve the CIA mission, you should first understand some necessary concepts\uff1a\n(1)entity: Entities represent source code files in CIA tasks, and all the CIA tasks under study are based on the Java language, so entities are files with the .java extension.\n(2)starting entity: The starting entity is also called salient entity, and the salient entity is the root change that causes the modification of the rest of entities in a change set, while the rest of entities are the dependency modification along with the salient one.\nYou will be presented with a starting entity and tools (functions) will be provided to access the more information of the origin system. Your task is to gradually explain which entity really need to be synchronized, based on the starting entity and the information obtained through the function-call. You have 7 chances to call the function to get more information."

SVGApplet (Conceptual Coupling Probability: 0.812): Although there is no direct structural dependency between `GridConstrainer.java` and `SVGApplet`, they share a high semantic similarity which indicates that changes to `GridConstrainer.java` may require corresponding changes to `SVGApplet` to maintain conceptual consistency.\n\n2. RotateHandle (Supports: 1, Confidence: 0.5): This entity has been co-changed with `GridConstrainer.java` in the past. Despite having no coupling dependencies, it was often modified alongside `GridConstrainer.java`, suggesting a potential need for synchronization when changes occur.\n\n3. AbstractRotateHandle (Supports: 1, Confidence: 0.5): Similar to `RotateHandle`, this entity shares the same support and confidence values. Even though there are no coupling dependencies detected, its history of co-change implies that it might need to be updated in conjunction with `GridConstrainer.java`.\n\n4. JDoubleTextField (Supports: 1, Confidence: 0.5): Although this entity has been removed from the current project version, it's included here for completeness based on historical co-change data.\n\n5. EditGridPanel (Supports: 1, Confidence: 0.5): This entity also lacks any coupling dependencies but has been changed together with `GridConstrainer.java` in the past, warranting consideration for synchronization.\n\n6. SimpleDrawing (Supports: 1, Confidence: 0.5): While it shows no evidence of direct interaction with `GridConstrainer.java`, its co-change history suggests it could potentially require updates when `GridConstrainer.java` is modified.\n\n7. StyleManager (Supports: 1, Confidence: 0.5): This entity does not have coupling dependencies with `GridConstrainer.java`, but it appears in the list due to previous co-changes.\n\n8. CssSample (Supports: 1, Confidence: 0.5): It shares the same characteristics as other entities listed above, with no coupling dependencies but has been co-changed historically.\n\n9. Drawing (Supports: 1, Confidence: 0.5): Like the others, it has no detected coupling dependencies but has shown a pattern of being modified along with `GridConstrainer.java`.\n\nPlease note that while these entities have been identified based on their co-change history, the actual need for synchronization should be assessed by considering the specific nature of the changes made to `GridConstrainer.java`.

SVGApplet (Conceptual Coupling Probability: 0.812): Although there is no direct structural dependency between `GridConstrainer.java` and `SVGApplet`, they share a high semantic similarity which indicates that changes to `GridConstrainer.java` may require corresponding changes to `SVGApplet` to maintain conceptual consistency.\n\n2. RotateHandle (Supports: 1, Confidence: 0.5): This entity has been co-changed with `GridConstrainer.java` in the past. Despite having no coupling dependencies, it was often modified alongside `GridConstrainer.java`, suggesting a potential need for synchronization when changes occur.\n\n3. AbstractRotateHandle (Supports: 1, Confidence: 0.5): Similar to `RotateHandle`, this entity shares the same support and confidence values. Even though there are no coupling dependencies detected, its history of co-change implies that it might need to be updated in conjunction with `GridConstrainer.java`.\n\n4. JDoubleTextField (Supports: 1, Confidence: 0.5): Although this entity has been removed from the current project version, it's included here for completeness based on historical co-change data.\n\n5. EditGridPanel (Supports: 1, Confidence: 0.5): This entity also lacks any coupling dependencies but has been changed together with `GridConstrainer.java` in the past, warranting consideration for synchronization.\n\n6. SimpleDrawing (Supports: 1, Confidence: 0.5): While it shows no evidence of direct interaction with `GridConstrainer.java`, its co-change history suggests it could potentially require updates when `GridConstrainer.java` is modified.\n\n7. StyleManager (Supports: 1, Confidence: 0.5): This entity does not have coupling dependencies with `GridConstrainer.java`, but it appears in the list due to previous co-changes.\n\n8. CssSample (Supports: 1, Confidence: 0.5): It shares the same characteristics as other entities listed above, with no coupling dependencies but has been co-changed historically.\n\n9. Drawing (Supports: 1, Confidence: 0.5): Like the others, it has no detected coupling dependencies but has shown a pattern of being modified along with `GridConstrainer.java`.\n\nPlease note that while these entities have been identified based on their co-change history, the actual need for synchronization should be assessed by considering the specific nature of the changes made to `GridConstrainer.java`.

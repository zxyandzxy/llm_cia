In order to help solve the CIA mission, you should first understand some necessary concepts\uff1a\n(1)entity: Entities represent source code files in CIA tasks, and all the CIA tasks under study are based on the Java language, so entities are files with the .java extension.\n(2)starting entity: The starting entity is also called salient entity, and the salient entity is the root change that causes the modification of the rest of entities in a change set, while the rest of entities are the dependency modification along with the salient one.\nYou will be presented with a starting entity and tools (functions) will be provided to access the more information of the origin system. Your task is to gradually explain which entity really need to be synchronized, based on the starting entity and the information obtained through the function-call. You have 7 chances to call the function to get more information."

Changes to `Figure` would very likely necessitate changes to `AbstractFigure` as well.\n\n2. **SimpleDrawingView**: Although there is no direct coupling dependency, this entity has a high conceptual coupling probability (0.776) with `Figure.java`. This implies that changes in `Figure` could affect the functionality or design related to `SimpleDrawingView`.\n\n3. **LineConnectionFigure**: It has been frequently co-changed with `Figure.java` (support of 14 out of 39 times) but does not have a direct coupling dependency. However, given its frequent appearance alongside `Figure` in past commits, it's worth considering for synchronization.\n\n4. **DrawingView**: Co-changed with `Figure.java` multiple times (support of 3), which suggests potential indirect dependencies or functional relevance that might require changes.\n\n5. **GroupFigure**: Appears in the co-change list (support of 3) indicating possible functional or structural relationships that may need synchronization.\n\n6. **LayersInspector**: Another entity frequently co-changed with `Figure.java` (support of 4), suggesting a need to be considered for potential updates.\n\n7. **RotateHandle**, **MoveHandle**, **ConnectionPointHandle**: All three entities have a confidence of 0.2051 with support of 8 each, implying they are often modified when `Figure.java` is changed. These handles may interact with figures in the drawing application, making them candidates for review during changes.\n\n8. **BoundsInLocalOutlineHandle**, **PointHandle**, **AbstractResizeHandle**: With supports of 2, these handles also show up in co-change scenarios and should be reviewed due to their interaction with figure manipulation.\n\n9. **TextFigure**, **EllipseFigure**, **LineFigure**, **RectangleFigure**: These graphical entities have appeared in the co-change list and may have some functional or structural connections with `Figure` requiring attention.\n\n10. **CompositeFigure**, **BorderDecorator**, **JavaDrawApp**, **CreationTool**, **ConnectionTool**: While these entities have lower supports and confidences compared to others, they still appear in the co-change list and may need to be checked for potential impacts from changes in `Figure.java`.\n\nEach entity listed in the change set needs to synchronize changes primarily because historical commit data indicates a pattern of co-modification. Direct coupling dependencies (like II between `Figure` and `AbstractFigure`) and conceptual similarities further reinforce the need for synchronization. Entities with higher support and confidence values are more likely to require changes when `Figure.java` is modified, hence they are prioritized in the change set.",

Changes to `Figure` would very likely necessitate changes to `AbstractFigure` as well.\n\n2. **SimpleDrawingView**: Although there is no direct coupling dependency, this entity has a high conceptual coupling probability (0.776) with `Figure.java`. This implies that changes in `Figure` could affect the functionality or design related to `SimpleDrawingView`.\n\n3. **LineConnectionFigure**: It has been frequently co-changed with `Figure.java` (support of 14 out of 39 times) but does not have a direct coupling dependency. However, given its frequent appearance alongside `Figure` in past commits, it's worth considering for synchronization.\n\n4. **DrawingView**: Co-changed with `Figure.java` multiple times (support of 3), which suggests potential indirect dependencies or functional relevance that might require changes.\n\n5. **GroupFigure**: Appears in the co-change list (support of 3) indicating possible functional or structural relationships that may need synchronization.\n\n6. **LayersInspector**: Another entity frequently co-changed with `Figure.java` (support of 4), suggesting a need to be considered for potential updates.\n\n7. **RotateHandle**, **MoveHandle**, **ConnectionPointHandle**: All three entities have a confidence of 0.2051 with support of 8 each, implying they are often modified when `Figure.java` is changed. These handles may interact with figures in the drawing application, making them candidates for review during changes.\n\n8. **BoundsInLocalOutlineHandle**, **PointHandle**, **AbstractResizeHandle**: With supports of 2, these handles also show up in co-change scenarios and should be reviewed due to their interaction with figure manipulation.\n\n9. **TextFigure**, **EllipseFigure**, **LineFigure**, **RectangleFigure**: These graphical entities have appeared in the co-change list and may have some functional or structural connections with `Figure` requiring attention.\n\n10. **CompositeFigure**, **BorderDecorator**, **JavaDrawApp**, **CreationTool**, **ConnectionTool**: While these entities have lower supports and confidences compared to others, they still appear in the co-change list and may need to be checked for potential impacts from changes in `Figure.java`.\n\nEach entity listed in the change set needs to synchronize changes primarily because historical commit data indicates a pattern of co-modification.

In order to help solve the CIA mission, you should first understand some necessary concepts\uff1a\n(1)entity: Entities represent source code files in CIA tasks, and all the CIA tasks under study are based on the Java language, so entities are files with the .java extension.\n(2)starting entity: The starting entity is also called salient entity, and the salient entity is the root change that causes the modification of the rest of entities in a change set, while the rest of entities are the dependency modification along with the salient one.\nYou will be presented with a starting entity and tools (functions) will be provided to access the more information of the origin system. Your task is to gradually explain which entity really need to be synchronized, based on the starting entity and the information obtained through the function-call. You have 7 chances to call the function to get more information."

Although there are no direct coupling dependencies between them, the high co-change frequency suggests that changes in `SVGDrawingPanel.java` should be accompanied by changes in `SVGView`.\n\n2. **SVGApplet**: Similar to `SVGView`, it has been co-changed 2 times with `SVGDrawingPanel.java`, also with a confidence level of 1.0. Despite the lack of coupling dependencies, the high co-change frequency indicates a strong association and need for synchronization.\n\n3. **SVGDrawingPanelBeanInfo**: This entity has a conceptual coupling probability of approximately 0.828 with `SVGDrawingPanel.java`. The semantic similarity suggests that they share related functionality or purpose, making it likely that changes in one would require changes in the other.\n\n4. **SVGApplicationModel**: Co-changed once with `SVGDrawingPanel.java` but does not have any coupling dependencies with it. Given the lower support and absence of coupling, it is less likely to need synchronization compared to the top three entities, but still worth considering due to its past co-change history.\n\n5. **ViewSourceAction**: Co-changed once with `SVGDrawingPanel.java` and lacks direct coupling dependencies. It ranks lower in terms of the necessity for synchronization, as indicated by the single support and lack of coupling.\n\n6. **AbstractDrawing**: Also co-changed once with `SVGDrawingPanel.java` without any coupling dependencies.

Although there are no direct coupling dependencies between them, the high co-change frequency suggests that changes in `SVGDrawingPanel.java` should be accompanied by changes in `SVGView`.\n\n2. **SVGApplet**: Similar to `SVGView`, it has been co-changed 2 times with `SVGDrawingPanel.java`, also with a confidence level of 1.0. Despite the lack of coupling dependencies, the high co-change frequency indicates a strong association and need for synchronization.\n\n3. **SVGDrawingPanelBeanInfo**: This entity has a conceptual coupling probability of approximately 0.828 with `SVGDrawingPanel.java`. The semantic similarity suggests that they share related functionality or purpose, making it likely that changes in one would require changes in the other.\n\n4. **SVGApplicationModel**: Co-changed once with `SVGDrawingPanel.java` but does not have any coupling dependencies with it. Given the lower support and absence of coupling, it is less likely to need synchronization compared to the top three entities, but still worth considering due to its past co-change history.\n\n5. **ViewSourceAction**: Co-changed once with `SVGDrawingPanel.java` and lacks direct coupling dependencies. It ranks lower in terms of the necessity for synchronization, as indicated by the single support and lack of coupling.\n\n6. **AbstractDrawing**: Also co-changed once with `SVGDrawingPanel.java` without any coupling dependencies.

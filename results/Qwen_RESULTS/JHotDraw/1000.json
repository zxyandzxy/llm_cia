This implies that changes in `View.java` could have a significant impact on `URIChooser`.\n\n3. **`DocumentOrientedApplication`**: Although this entity was removed from the project due to version iteration, historically it had a co-change confidence of 0.67 with `View.java`. It's included here for historical context but won't be relevant for current versions.\n\n4. **`SaveAction`**: With a support count of 1 and a confidence of 0.17, this entity has a lower likelihood of requiring synchronization compared to the top two.

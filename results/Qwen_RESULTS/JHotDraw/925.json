Changes in geometric calculations may directly impact the shapes being drawn or manipulated by this class. Thus, it is highly likely that changes to `Geom.java` will require corresponding modifications in `Shapes`.\n  \n- **SimpleDrawingView**: With 2 supports and a confidence level of 0.333, this entity has been modified alongside `Geom.java` several times in the past. It suggests that there might be shared functionality or dependencies between these two entities that necessitate synchronized updates.\n  \n- **ChopRectangleConnector**: Similarly to `SimpleDrawingView`, this entity also has 2 supports and a confidence level of 0.333. The co-change pattern indicates that changes to `Geom.java` have historically required changes to `ChopRectangleConnector`, possibly due to related functionality in handling geometric properties for connectors.\n  \n- **RotateHandle, SimpleDrawing, SimpleLayer, TransformableFigure, GrowStroke, AbstractLabelFigure, Scratchpad, LabelFigure, Subpath, OffsetStroke, FlatteningGrowStroke, DrawingView, LineConnectionFigure, PropertyAt, ConnectionFigure, ConnectingFiguresSample, CenterConnector, ChopEllipseConnector, LineConnectionTool, SimpleDragTracker, AbstractConnector, ConnectionPointHandle, BoundsInLocalOutlineHandle**: Each of these entities has shown up at least once during the co-changes with `Geom.java`. While their confidence levels are lower than those of `SimpleDrawingView` and `ChopRectangleConnector`, they still represent a potential need for synchronization based on historical change patterns. The likelihood of requiring synchronized changes decreases as we move down the list, but all should be considered due to the observed co-change behavior.\n\nThe elements in the Change set are sorted in descending order of the likelihood of synchronized modifications.

Changes in geometric calculations may directly impact the shapes being drawn or manipulated by this class. Thus, it is highly likely that changes to `Geom.java` will require corresponding modifications in `Shapes`.\n  \n- **SimpleDrawingView**: With 2 supports and a confidence level of 0.333, this entity has been modified alongside `Geom.java` several times in the past. It suggests that there might be shared functionality or dependencies between these two entities that necessitate synchronized updates.\n  \n- **ChopRectangleConnector**: Similarly to `SimpleDrawingView`, this entity also has 2 supports and a confidence level of 0.333. The co-change pattern indicates that changes to `Geom.java` have historically required changes to `ChopRectangleConnector`, possibly due to related functionality in handling geometric properties for connectors.\n  \n- **RotateHandle, SimpleDrawing, SimpleLayer, TransformableFigure, GrowStroke, AbstractLabelFigure, Scratchpad, LabelFigure, Subpath, OffsetStroke, FlatteningGrowStroke, DrawingView, LineConnectionFigure, PropertyAt, ConnectionFigure, ConnectingFiguresSample, CenterConnector, ChopEllipseConnector, LineConnectionTool, SimpleDragTracker, AbstractConnector, ConnectionPointHandle, BoundsInLocalOutlineHandle**: Each of these entities has shown up at least once during the co-changes with `Geom.java`. While their confidence levels are lower than those of `SimpleDrawingView` and `ChopRectangleConnector`, they still represent a potential need for synchronization based on historical change patterns. The likelihood of requiring synchronized changes decreases as we move down the list, but all should be considered due to the observed co-change behavior.\n\nThe elements in the Change set are sorted in descending order of the likelihood of synchronized modifications.

Moreover, it implements the `DrawingEditor` interface, indicating that any modifications in `DrawingEditor` could directly impact `DefaultDrawingEditor`.\n\n2. **ButtonFactory.java**: It appears twice alongside `DrawingEditor.java` during past changes, giving it a confidence level of 0.5. This suggests there is some form of interaction or dependency between these entities that warrants attention when changes occur.\n\n3. **DrawingEditorProxy.java**: Similarly to `ButtonFactory.java`, this entity has a support count of 2 and a confidence level of 0.5. Changes to `DrawingEditor` might require corresponding adjustments in `DrawingEditorProxy` due to their historical co-modification pattern.\n\n4. **AbstractTool.java**: With a support count of 2 and a confidence of 0.5, this class may be indirectly affected by changes to `DrawingEditor`. The co-change pattern indicates a possible dependency or shared functionality.\n\nThe following entities have a lower support count (1) and confidence (0.25), but they still appear relevant based on historical co-changes:\n\n5. **SVGTextFigure.java**\n6. **TextFigure.java**\n7. **SVGImageFigure.java**\n8. **ApplyAttributesAction.java**\n9. **ToggleGridAction.java**\n10. **PickAttributesAction.java**\n11. **ImageMapOutputFormat.java**\n12. **JDoubleAttributeSlider.java**\n13. **JStringAttributeField.java**\n14. **JStringAttributeArea.java**\n15. **AbstractSelectedAction.java**\n16. **AttributeFieldEventHandler.java**\n17. **EventHandler.java**\n18. **SelectionColorIcon.java**\n19. **EditorEventHandler.java**\n20. **PaletteToolBarUI.java**\n21. **SelectionComponentRepainter.java**\n\nThese entities, although less frequently changed together with `DrawingEditor.java`, might still need to be reviewed for potential impacts from changes in `DrawingEditor`. They may share common functionality or dependencies that are not as strong or obvious as those with `DefaultDrawingEditor.java`, `ButtonFactory.java`, `DrawingEditorProxy.java`, and `AbstractTool.java`.

Moreover, it implements the `DrawingEditor` interface, indicating that any modifications in `DrawingEditor` could directly impact `DefaultDrawingEditor`.\n\n2. **ButtonFactory.java**: It appears twice alongside `DrawingEditor.java` during past changes, giving it a confidence level of 0.5. This suggests there is some form of interaction or dependency between these entities that warrants attention when changes occur.\n\n3. **DrawingEditorProxy.java**: Similarly to `ButtonFactory.java`, this entity has a support count of 2 and a confidence level of 0.5. Changes to `DrawingEditor` might require corresponding adjustments in `DrawingEditorProxy` due to their historical co-modification pattern.\n\n4. **AbstractTool.java**: With a support count of 2 and a confidence of 0.5, this class may be indirectly affected by changes to `DrawingEditor`. The co-change pattern indicates a possible dependency or shared functionality.\n\nThe following entities have a lower support count (1) and confidence (0.25), but they still appear relevant based on historical co-changes:\n\n5. **SVGTextFigure.java**\n6. **TextFigure.java**\n7. **SVGImageFigure.java**\n8. **ApplyAttributesAction.java**\n9. **ToggleGridAction.java**\n10. **PickAttributesAction.java**\n11. **ImageMapOutputFormat.java**\n12. **JDoubleAttributeSlider.java**\n13. **JStringAttributeField.java**\n14. **JStringAttributeArea.java**\n15. **AbstractSelectedAction.java**\n16. **AttributeFieldEventHandler.java**\n17. **EventHandler.java**\n18. **SelectionColorIcon.java**\n19. **EditorEventHandler.java**\n20. **PaletteToolBarUI.java**\n21. **SelectionComponentRepainter.java**\n\nThese entities, although less frequently changed together with `DrawingEditor.java`, might still need to be reviewed for potential impacts from changes in `DrawingEditor`. They may share common functionality or dependencies that are not as strong or obvious as those with `DefaultDrawingEditor.java`, `ButtonFactory.java`, `DrawingEditorProxy.java`, and `AbstractTool.java`. Therefore, while the likelihood of needing synchronized modifications is lower, they should not be completely overlooked during the change impact analysis process.",

The confidence score of 1.0 indicates that every time `EditableComponent.java` was changed, `CutAction.java` was also modified.\n\n2. CopyAction.java (Supports: 2, Confidence: 1.0): Similar to `CutAction.java`, `CopyAction.java` shares a strong co-change relationship with `EditableComponent.java`, necessitating careful consideration for synchronized modifications.\n\n3. PasteAction.java (Supports: 2, Confidence: 1.0): Changes to `EditableComponent.java` have historically been accompanied by changes to `PasteAction.java`, indicating a high likelihood of needing concurrent updates.\n\n4. SelectAllAction.java (Supports: 2, Confidence: 1.0): With a confidence score of 1.0, this entity should be considered for synchronization as it shows a pattern of being modified alongside `EditableComponent.java`.\n\n5. ClearSelectionAction.java (Supports: 2, Confidence: 1.0): This entity has been modified whenever `EditableComponent.java` was changed, suggesting a need for synchronized changes.\n\n6. DeleteAction.java (Supports: 2, Confidence: 1.0): Like the above actions, this action class is closely related and should be reviewed when changes are made to `EditableComponent.java`.\n\n7. DuplicateAction.java (Supports: 1, Confidence: 0.5): Although the support is lower than the previous entities, there is still a notable chance that `DuplicateAction.java` may need to be updated along with `EditableComponent.java`.\n\n8. AbstractSelectionAction.java (Supports: 1, Confidence: 0.5): Given its moderate confidence score, this entity might require attention during changes to `EditableComponent.java`.\n\n9. DefaultDrawingView.java (Supports: 1, Confidence: 0.5): Despite having a lower confidence score, it's included due to its co-change history with `EditableComponent.java`.\n\n10. SimpleDrawingView.java (Supports: 1, Confidence: 0.5): This entity appears less frequently but is still worth considering for potential synchronized changes.\n\nEntities from 11 to 20 (DocumentOrientedApplication.java, AbstractTool.java, SimpleLabelFigure.java, SelectionTool.java, CreationTool.java, DrawingEditor.java, SimpleDrawingViewNode.java, ToolsToolbar.java, SimpleDrawingEditor.java, NewFXMain.java) all have a single instance of co-change and a confidence of 0.5. While these entities are less likely to require changes compared to those higher on the list, they still share a co-change relationship with `EditableComponent.java` and should be kept in mind for thorough analysis.\n\nIt is important to note that although some of these entities do not show direct coupling or call graph dependencies with `EditableComponent.java`, their semantic similarity and historical co-change patterns suggest that they are part of the same functional context within the application.

The confidence score of 1.0 indicates that every time `EditableComponent.java` was changed, `CutAction.java` was also modified.\n\n2. CopyAction.java (Supports: 2, Confidence: 1.0): Similar to `CutAction.java`, `CopyAction.java` shares a strong co-change relationship with `EditableComponent.java`, necessitating careful consideration for synchronized modifications.\n\n3. PasteAction.java (Supports: 2, Confidence: 1.0): Changes to `EditableComponent.java` have historically been accompanied by changes to `PasteAction.java`, indicating a high likelihood of needing concurrent updates.\n\n4. SelectAllAction.java (Supports: 2, Confidence: 1.0): With a confidence score of 1.0, this entity should be considered for synchronization as it shows a pattern of being modified alongside `EditableComponent.java`.\n\n5. ClearSelectionAction.java (Supports: 2, Confidence: 1.0): This entity has been modified whenever `EditableComponent.java` was changed, suggesting a need for synchronized changes.\n\n6. DeleteAction.java (Supports: 2, Confidence: 1.0): Like the above actions, this action class is closely related and should be reviewed when changes are made to `EditableComponent.java`.\n\n7. DuplicateAction.java (Supports: 1, Confidence: 0.5): Although the support is lower than the previous entities, there is still a notable chance that `DuplicateAction.java` may need to be updated along with `EditableComponent.java`.\n\n8. AbstractSelectionAction.java (Supports: 1, Confidence: 0.5): Given its moderate confidence score, this entity might require attention during changes to `EditableComponent.java`.\n\n9. DefaultDrawingView.java (Supports: 1, Confidence: 0.5): Despite having a lower confidence score, it's included due to its co-change history with `EditableComponent.java`.\n\n10. SimpleDrawingView.java (Supports: 1, Confidence: 0.5): This entity appears less frequently but is still worth considering for potential synchronized changes.\n\nEntities from 11 to 20 (DocumentOrientedApplication.java, AbstractTool.java, SimpleLabelFigure.java, SelectionTool.java, CreationTool.java, DrawingEditor.java, SimpleDrawingViewNode.java, ToolsToolbar.java, SimpleDrawingEditor.java, NewFXMain.java) all have a single instance of co-change and a confidence of 0.5. While these entities are less likely to require changes compared to those higher on the list, they still share a co-change relationship with `EditableComponent.java` and should be kept in mind for thorough analysis.\n\nIt is important to note that although some of these entities do not show direct coupling or call graph dependencies with `EditableComponent.java`, their semantic similarity and historical co-change patterns suggest that they are part of the same functional context within the application.

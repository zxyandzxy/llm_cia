This result, combined with the empty call graph, suggests that the relationship between these entities is neither through direct calls nor through any of the 18 types of coupling dependencies we checked.\n\nHowever, since the co-change analysis indicated a strong correlation between `EditableComponent.java` and several action classes like `CopyAction`, it's possible that their relationship is driven by other factors not captured by call graphs or coupling dependencies. For instance, they might be part of the same feature set or interact indirectly through user interactions or design patterns within the application.\n\nTo explore this further, let's check for conceptual coupling using the `get_conceptual_coupling` function. Conceptual coupling measures semantic similarity based on natural language processing techniques, which could reveal indirect relationships between `EditableComponent.java` and the highly correlated entities identified earlier.

This suggests that they likely serve related functionality within the application, even if they do not directly interact at the code level.\n\nLet's now check for conceptual coupling with another strongly correlated entity from our initial co-change analysis list, such as `DeleteAction`, to see if we can find similar patterns.",

Therefore, any modifications to `EditableComponent.java` should prompt a review of `DeleteAction` for potential changes.\n\n3. **CutAction**, **PasteAction**, **SelectAllAction**, **ClearSelectionAction**: These entities all have a support of 2 and a confidence of 1.0 when co-changed with `EditableComponent.java`. While their conceptual coupling wasn't explicitly measured, given their similar co-change patterns with `EditableComponent.java`, they should be reviewed for possible synchronization.\n\n4. **DuplicateAction**, **AbstractSelectionAction**: Both entities have a lower support (1) and confidence (0.5) but still appear in the co-change history. The lack of high support may indicate less frequent but still relevant changes that could be related to feature updates or bug fixes involving `EditableComponent.java`.\n\n5. **SimpleDrawingView**, **DocumentOrientedApplication**, **SimpleLabelFigure**, **SelectionTool**, **CreationTool**, **DrawingEditor**, **SimpleDrawingViewNode**, **ToolsToolbar**, **SimpleDrawingEditor**, **NewFXMain**: These entities have a lower support and confidence in the co-change analysis. Their inclusion is based on the assumption that they share some functional or architectural relationship with `EditableComponent.java`, though the exact nature of these relationships was not fully explored through additional function calls due to the limited number of available checks.\n\nIn summary, the change set prioritizes entities based on their historical co-change frequency and strength of relationship with `EditableComponent.java`.

For instance, they might be part of the same feature set or interact indirectly through user interactions or design patterns within the application.\n\nTo explore this further, let's check for conceptual coupling using the `get_conceptual_coupling` function. Conceptual coupling measures semantic similarity based on natural language processing techniques, which could reveal indirect relationships between `EditableComponent.java` and the highly correlated entities identified earlier.

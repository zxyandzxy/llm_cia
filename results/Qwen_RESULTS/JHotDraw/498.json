Therefore, it should not be considered for synchronization in the present context.\n  \n- **SelectionTool.java**: This entity has a significant co-change frequency with `DrawingView.java` (support count of 4 and confidence of 0.67). Despite the lack of direct coupling dependencies, there is a relatively high conceptual coupling score of approximately 0.776, which suggests that they share common functionality or context. Changes to `DrawingView.java` are likely to necessitate changes to `SelectionTool.java` to maintain consistency across related functionalities.\n\n- **AbstractCompositeFigure.java**: This entity also appeared in the co-change results with a support count of 1 and confidence of 0.17. While its co-change frequency is lower compared to `SelectionTool.java`, it still indicates some level of dependency or shared context. It is included in the change set as a precautionary measure given its past co-change history with `DrawingView.java`.\n\n- **Handle**: This entity was directly used by `DrawingView.java` according to the call graph analysis. Even though it did not appear in the co-change list, the direct usage suggests that any modifications to `DrawingView.java` might affect how `Handle` is utilized, making it necessary to synchronize changes.\n\n- **FigureSelectionListener**: Similar to `Handle`, this entity was directly used by `DrawingView.java`. It is included in the change set due to the potential impact of changes made to `DrawingView.java` on the usage of `FigureSelectionListener`.\n\nThe elements in the Change set are sorted in descending order of the likelihood of synchronized modifications based on their co-change frequencies and relationships with `DrawingView.java`. The entities `SelectionTool.java` and `AbstractCompositeFigure.java` are prioritized higher because of their co-change histories, while `Handle` and `FigureSelectionListener` are included due to their direct usage within `DrawingView.java`.

Therefore, it should not be considered for synchronization in the present context.\n  \n- **SelectionTool.java**: This entity has a significant co-change frequency with `DrawingView.java` (support count of 4 and confidence of 0.67). Despite the lack of direct coupling dependencies, there is a relatively high conceptual coupling score of approximately 0.776, which suggests that they share common functionality or context. Changes to `DrawingView.java` are likely to necessitate changes to `SelectionTool.java` to maintain consistency across related functionalities.\n\n- **AbstractCompositeFigure.java**: This entity also appeared in the co-change results with a support count of 1 and confidence of 0.17. While its co-change frequency is lower compared to `SelectionTool.java`, it still indicates some level of dependency or shared context. It is included in the change set as a precautionary measure given its past co-change history with `DrawingView.java`.\n\n- **Handle**: This entity was directly used by `DrawingView.java` according to the call graph analysis. Even though it did not appear in the co-change list, the direct usage suggests that any modifications to `DrawingView.java` might affect how `Handle` is utilized, making it necessary to synchronize changes.\n\n- **FigureSelectionListener**: Similar to `Handle`, this entity was directly used by `DrawingView.java`. It is included in the change set due to the potential impact of changes made to `DrawingView.java` on the usage of `FigureSelectionListener`.\n\nThe elements in the Change set are sorted in descending order of the likelihood of synchronized modifications based on their co-change frequencies and relationships with `DrawingView.java`. The entities `SelectionTool.java` and `AbstractCompositeFigure.java` are prioritized higher because of their co-change histories, while `Handle` and `FigureSelectionListener` are included due to their direct usage within `DrawingView.java`.

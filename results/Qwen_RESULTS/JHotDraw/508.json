In order to help solve the CIA mission, you should first understand some necessary concepts\uff1a\n(1)entity: Entities represent source code files in CIA tasks, and all the CIA tasks under study are based on the Java language, so entities are files with the .java extension.\n(2)starting entity: The starting entity is also called salient entity, and the salient entity is the root change that causes the modification of the rest of entities in a change set, while the rest of entities are the dependency modification along with the salient one.\nYou will be presented with a starting entity and tools (functions) will be provided to access the more information of the origin system. Your task is to gradually explain which entity really need to be synchronized, based on the starting entity and the information obtained through the function-call. You have 7 chances to call the function to get more information."

This indicates a strong semantic relationship, which means that changes to `ConvexHull.java` may require reviewing or modifying `SVGPathFigure.java` to ensure consistency in the related functionality.\n\n2. **DefaultDrawingView**: The co-change history suggests that this entity was modified alongside `ConvexHull.java`. Even though there are no detected coupling dependencies, it might be relevant due to shared functionality or context within the application's drawing view components. It should be considered for synchronization during changes to `ConvexHull.java`.\n\n3. **Main**: Although there are no coupling dependencies with `ConvexHull.java`, it has been changed together with `ConvexHull.java` in the past. Since `Main.java` typically serves as an entry point for execution, any changes affecting core functionalities could potentially impact how the application runs. Therefore, it should be reviewed for potential synchronization.\n\n4. **ConvexHullOutlineHandle**: Similarly, this entity was co-changed with `ConvexHull.java`, but no coupling dependencies were found. Given its name and association with `ConvexHull`, it might be involved in handling interactions or manipulations of convex hulls in the graphical user interface. While it lacks direct code-level dependencies, it is still recommended for review when changing `ConvexHull.java`.\n\nPlease note that `Polygon2D` has been excluded from the change set since it has been removed from the project in later versions and is no longer relevant.\n\nIn summary, although some entities do not have direct coupling dependencies with `ConvexHull.java`, their historical co-change patterns suggest they should be reviewed for synchronization.

This indicates a strong semantic relationship, which means that changes to `ConvexHull.java` may require reviewing or modifying `SVGPathFigure.java` to ensure consistency in the related functionality.\n\n2. **DefaultDrawingView**: The co-change history suggests that this entity was modified alongside `ConvexHull.java`. Even though there are no detected coupling dependencies, it might be relevant due to shared functionality or context within the application's drawing view components. It should be considered for synchronization during changes to `ConvexHull.java`.\n\n3. **Main**: Although there are no coupling dependencies with `ConvexHull.java`, it has been changed together with `ConvexHull.java` in the past. Since `Main.java` typically serves as an entry point for execution, any changes affecting core functionalities could potentially impact how the application runs. Therefore, it should be reviewed for potential synchronization.\n\n4. **ConvexHullOutlineHandle**: Similarly, this entity was co-changed with `ConvexHull.java`, but no coupling dependencies were found. Given its name and association with `ConvexHull`, it might be involved in handling interactions or manipulations of convex hulls in the graphical user interface. While it lacks direct code-level dependencies, it is still recommended for review when changing `ConvexHull.java`.\n\nPlease note that `Polygon2D` has been excluded from the change set since it has been removed from the project in later versions and is no longer relevant.\n\nIn summary, although some entities do not have direct coupling dependencies with `ConvexHull.java`, their historical co-change patterns suggest they should be reviewed for synchronization.

Furthermore, the conceptual coupling between `Drawing.java` and `DefaultDrawing` is 0.773, which is the highest among all analyzed entities. This indicates that they share very similar functionality or features, making it highly likely that changes to `Drawing.java` will necessitate changes to `DefaultDrawing`.\n\n2. **QuadTreeDrawing**: This entity also has a high confidence score of 0.5714 from the co-change relationship with `Drawing.java`. Although there are no direct coupling dependencies, the conceptual coupling of 0.767 suggests significant semantic similarity, indicating that these two entities are often modified together due to their related functionalities.\n\n3. **DefaultDrawingView**: It appears with a confidence score of 0.2857. While its conceptual coupling wasn't explicitly checked, given its moderate confidence score, it might still be relevant when considering changes to `Drawing.java`, especially if it interacts with the visual representation of drawings.\n\n4. **SVGImageFigure** and **ImageFigure**: Both entities have low confidence scores of 0.1429. They may not be directly coupled but could be conceptually related to `Drawing.java` in the context of image handling within drawings.\n\n5. **SVGInputFormat** and **SVGZOutputFormat**: These entities appear with a confidence score of 0.1429. They relate to the input and output formats for SVG files, which could be indirectly related to drawing operations.\n\n6. **UndoableAdapter**, **UndoManager**, **UndoableCommand**: These entities also show up with a confidence score of 0.1429. They are part of the undo/redo mechanism, which can be impacted by changes in how drawings are created or manipulated.\n\nEach of these entities should be reviewed for potential synchronization when modifying `Drawing.java`.

Furthermore, the conceptual coupling between `Drawing.java` and `DefaultDrawing` is 0.773, which is the highest among all analyzed entities.

Although there are no direct coupling dependencies, the conceptual coupling of 0.767 suggests significant semantic similarity, indicating that these two entities are often modified together due to their related functionalities.\n\n3. **DefaultDrawingView**: It appears with a confidence score of 0.2857. While its conceptual coupling wasn't explicitly checked, given its moderate confidence score, it might still be relevant when considering changes to `Drawing.java`, especially if it interacts with the visual representation of drawings.\n\n4. **SVGImageFigure** and **ImageFigure**: Both entities have low confidence scores of 0.1429. They may not be directly coupled but could be conceptually related to `Drawing.java` in the context of image handling within drawings.\n\n5. **SVGInputFormat** and **SVGZOutputFormat**: These entities appear with a confidence score of 0.1429.

They are part of the undo/redo mechanism, which can be impacted by changes in how drawings are created or manipulated.\n\nEach of these entities should be reviewed for potential synchronization when modifying `Drawing.java`.

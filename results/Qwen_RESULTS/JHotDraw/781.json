However, there are no coupling dependencies or call graph connections between them. The lack of direct relationships could mean that the co-change pattern is either outdated or influenced by factors outside the scope of our current analysis. Despite this, due to historical co-change support, it should be considered for synchronization.\n\n2. **EventHandler.java**: Similar to `DefaultHandleTracker.java`, this entity has shown a co-change relationship with `BezierNodeHandle.java`. But it's important to note that `EventHandler.java` has been removed from the project in its current iteration. Therefore, while it historically had a strong co-change correlation (with a confidence of 1.0), it is no longer relevant to the current version of the project. It should not require any synchronized modifications today.\n\nThe elements in the Change set are sorted in descending order of the likelihood of synchronized modifications based on historical co-change patterns. However, it's essential to consider the context that `EventHandler.java` is no longer part of the project, which significantly reduces its relevance for current synchronizations. Meanwhile, although `DefaultHandleTracker.java` does not show direct coupling or call graph connections with `BezierNodeHandle.java`, its co-change history suggests it should still be monitored for potential required changes alongside `BezierNodeHandle.java`. \n\nPlease note that additional manual inspection or other forms of analysis may be necessary to confirm these findings, as the automated tools used here did not provide evidence of direct dependencies.",

However, there are no coupling dependencies or call graph connections between them. The lack of direct relationships could mean that the co-change pattern is either outdated or influenced by factors outside the scope of our current analysis. Despite this, due to historical co-change support, it should be considered for synchronization.\n\n2. **EventHandler.java**: Similar to `DefaultHandleTracker.java`, this entity has shown a co-change relationship with `BezierNodeHandle.java`. But it's important to note that `EventHandler.java` has been removed from the project in its current iteration. Therefore, while it historically had a strong co-change correlation (with a confidence of 1.0), it is no longer relevant to the current version of the project. It should not require any synchronized modifications today.\n\nThe elements in the Change set are sorted in descending order of the likelihood of synchronized modifications based on historical co-change patterns. However, it's essential to consider the context that `EventHandler.java` is no longer part of the project, which significantly reduces its relevance for current synchronizations. Meanwhile, although `DefaultHandleTracker.java` does not show direct coupling or call graph connections with `BezierNodeHandle.java`, its co-change history suggests it should still be monitored for potential required changes alongside `BezierNodeHandle.java`. \n\nPlease note that additional manual inspection or other forms of analysis may be necessary to confirm these findings, as the automated tools used here did not provide evidence of direct dependencies.",

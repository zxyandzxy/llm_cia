In order to help solve the CIA mission, you should first understand some necessary concepts\uff1a\n(1)entity: Entities represent source code files in CIA tasks, and all the CIA tasks under study are based on the Java language, so entities are files with the .java extension.\n(2)starting entity: The starting entity is also called salient entity, and the salient entity is the root change that causes the modification of the rest of entities in a change set, while the rest of entities are the dependency modification along with the salient one.\nYou will be presented with a starting entity and tools (functions) will be provided to access the more information of the origin system. Your task is to gradually explain which entity really need to be synchronized, based on the starting entity and the information obtained through the function-call. You have 7 chances to call the function to get more information."

Furthermore, it shares a high semantic similarity probability (0.84), which suggests that despite the lack of direct coupling dependencies or call graph connections, it is conceptually related and should be reviewed or modified alongside `BezierPath.java`.\n\n2. **`BezierFigure.java`**: With a co-change count of 2 out of 5 and a very high semantic similarity probability (0.86), this entity is highly likely to require synchronization with `BezierPath.java`. The strong conceptual overlap indicates that changes in one will often necessitate changes in the other.\n\n3. **`BezierDemo.java`**: Although it has a lower semantic similarity probability (0.71) compared to the previous two entities, it still shows a notable co-change frequency (2 out of 5).

While they share some form of relationship through co-change patterns, their need for synchronization is less certain without further evidence of coupling or conceptual similarity.

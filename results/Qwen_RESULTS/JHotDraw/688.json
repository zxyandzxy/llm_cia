In order to help solve the CIA mission, you should first understand some necessary concepts\uff1a\n(1)entity: Entities represent source code files in CIA tasks, and all the CIA tasks under study are based on the Java language, so entities are files with the .java extension.\n(2)starting entity: The starting entity is also called salient entity, and the salient entity is the root change that causes the modification of the rest of entities in a change set, while the rest of entities are the dependency modification along with the salient one.\nYou will be presented with a starting entity and tools (functions) will be provided to access the more information of the origin system. Your task is to gradually explain which entity really need to be synchronized, based on the starting entity and the information obtained through the function-call.

Although there was no direct reference found in the call graph, their close functional relationship suggests that changes in one could impact the other.\n\n3. **CloseFileAction**: This entity has been modified together with `View.java` two times out of six changes (confidence of 0.33). It indicates a moderate likelihood of needing synchronization when changes occur in `View.java`.\n\n4. **SaveAction**: Similarly, `SaveAction` appeared in the modification history seven times out of eight changes related to `View.java` (confidence of 0.875), but since it was removed from the project, we should consider this relationship less relevant.\n\n5. **OpenRecentFileAction**: With a confidence of 0.16666666666666666, this entity has appeared once alongside `View.java`.

Your task is to gradually explain which entity really need to be synchronized, based on the starting entity and the information obtained through the function-call.

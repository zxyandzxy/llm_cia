However, since the support is only 1, indicating that this co-change happened only once, it might be worth reviewing the specific change history to understand the context better before making any final decisions.\n\nIf we have remaining function calls, we may want to check the conceptual coupling with other entities from the co-change list to see if they also share a similar high semantic relationship.

However, since the support is only 1, indicating that this co-change happened only once, it might be worth reviewing the specific change history to understand the context better before making any final decisions.\n\nIf we have remaining function calls, we may want to check the conceptual coupling with other entities from the co-change list to see if they also share a similar high semantic relationship.

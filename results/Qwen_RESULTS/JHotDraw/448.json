BezierTool: The `get_co_change_relationship` function has indicated a strong co-change relationship between `Bezier.java` and `BezierTool`, with a support count of 1 and a confidence of 1.0, meaning that every time `Bezier.java` was changed, `BezierTool` was also modified. Furthermore, the `get_conceptual_coupling` function revealed a high semantic similarity probability of approximately 0.821, suggesting a strong conceptual relationship. Although there are no direct coupling dependencies or call graph interactions between the two entities, the combined evidence from co-change history and conceptual coupling indicates that changes to `Bezier.java` will likely require corresponding changes to `BezierTool` to maintain consistency within the software system. \n\nBased on this analysis, it is recommended to include `BezierTool` in the set of entities that need to be synchronized when `Bezier.java` is modified.

In order to help solve the CIA mission, you should first understand some necessary concepts\uff1a\n(1)entity: Entities represent source code files in CIA tasks, and all the CIA tasks under study are based on the Java language, so entities are files with the .java extension.\n(2)starting entity: The starting entity is also called salient entity, and the salient entity is the root change that causes the modification of the rest of entities in a change set, while the rest of entities are the dependency modification along with the salient one.\nYou will be presented with a starting entity and tools (functions) will be provided to access the more information of the origin system. Your task is to gradually explain which entity really need to be synchronized, based on the starting entity and the information obtained through the function-call. You have 7 chances to call the function to get more information."

Entities like `GUI`, `Canvas`, and `TilePanel` show relatively high confidence values, indicating they are frequently modified alongside `ImageLibrary.java`.\n- Even though coupling analysis between `ImageLibrary.java` and these entities showed no direct syntactic dependencies, their conceptual coupling (e.g., shared responsibility in rendering or managing UI assets) likely explains the strong co-change patterns.\n- Many of the entities belong to UI components or image/resource management systems, suggesting that changes in `ImageLibrary.java` may indirectly influence them through runtime behavior, asset loading, or event-driven interactions.\n- Entities such as `ImageProvider`, `ResourceManager`, and `TileType` appear in both the call graph and co-change list, reinforcing their relevance in propagating changes.\n- To ensure recall, all entities with a support count \u22651 are included, covering more than 40 files to minimize the risk of missing potential ripple effects.",

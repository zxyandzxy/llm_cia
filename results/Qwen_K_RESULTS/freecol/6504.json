This entity should be considered for synchronization.\n\n2. **InGameController.java**  \n   - Support: 3 times co-changed\n   - Confidence: 75%\n   - Another key entity showing a high likelihood of dependency. Should also be synchronized.\n\nThese two entities are the most significant candidates for synchronization due to their high confidence and support values.\n\n---\n\n### Entities with Low-Medium Co-Change Frequency:\nThe rest of the list includes entities like:\n- `StealLandMessage.java`\n- `FreeColServer.java`\n- `BuyLandMessage.java`\n- `Canvas.java`\n- ...and others (a total of 17 entities)\n\nAll these have:\n- Support: 1 time co-changed\n- Confidence: 25%\n\nWhile they were modified alongside `Message.java` in some cases, the low confidence suggests weaker or situational dependencies. These may not require synchronization unless further analysis confirms coupling.\n\n---\n\nTo proceed, I will analyze the top candidates (`InGameInputHandler.java` and `InGameController.java`) further by checking their code coupling dependencies with `Message.java`.

Here's how we interpret the results:\n\n### Entities with High Co-Change Frequency (Support >= 2 and Confidence >= 0.75):\n1. **InGameInputHandler.java**  \n   - Support: 3 times co-changed\n   - Confidence: 75%\n   - Likely has a strong functional dependency with `Message.java`. This entity should be considered for synchronization.\n\n2. **InGameController.java**  \n   - Support: 3 times co-changed\n   - Confidence: 75%\n   - Another key entity showing a high likelihood of dependency. Should also be synchronized.\n\nThese two entities are the most significant candidates for synchronization due to their high confidence and support values.\n\n---\n\n### Entities with Low-Medium Co-Change Frequency:\nThe rest of the list includes entities like:\n- `StealLandMessage.java`\n- `FreeColServer.java`\n- `BuyLandMessage.java`\n- `Canvas.java`\n- ...and others (a total of 17 entities)\n\nAll these have:\n- Support: 1 time co-changed\n- Confidence: 25%\n\nWhile they were modified alongside `Message.java` in some cases, the low confidence suggests weaker or situational dependencies. These may not require synchronization unless further analysis confirms coupling.\n\n---\n\nTo proceed, I will analyze the top candidates (`InGameInputHandler.java` and `InGameController.java`) further by checking their code coupling dependencies with `Message.java`.

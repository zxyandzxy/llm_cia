Likely foundational class for AI-related entities; may share conceptual or inheritance relationships.  \n- **ColonialAIPlayer**: Co-change support is 1 with confidence 0.33. May be tightly related to AIMain through shared logic or structure.  \n- **StandardAIPlayer**: Co-change support is 1 with confidence 0.33. Likely shares common ancestry or interface with other AI players.  \n- **IndianBringGiftMission**: Co-change support is 1 with confidence 0.33. Part of mission-based AI logic tied to main AI system.  \n- **IndianAIPlayer**: Co-change support is 1 with confidence 0.33. Part of core AI player framework.  \n- **IndianDemandMission**: Co-change support is 1 with confidence 0.33. Related to AI mission execution.  \n- **NewAIPlayer**: Co-change support is 1 with confidence 0.33. Likely part of the same modular AI player system.  \n- **AIGoods**: Co-change support is 1 with confidence 0.33. Handles goods-related AI logic that may be invoked from AIMain.  \n- **AIColony**: Co-change support is 1 with confidence 0.33. Core colony management by AI likely interacts with AIMain.  \n- **TileImprovementPlan**: Co-change support is 1 with confidence 0.33. Part of AI planning system.  \n- **Wish**: Co-change support is 1 with confidence 0.33. Base class or interface for wish-based AI logic.  \n- **WishRealizationMission**: Co-change support is 1 with confidence 0.33. Execution logic for wish fulfillment.  \n- **WorkerWish**: Co-change support is 1 with confidence 0.33. Specific type of wish tied to worker behavior.  \n- **Mission**: Co-change support is 1 with confidence 0.33. Base class or central component in mission execution.  \n- **AIPlayer**: Likely a superclass or closely used class with strong conceptual coupling.  \n- **AITile**: Possibly involved in tile-level decision making from AIMain.  \n- **AIUnit**: Likely manages unit-level decisions derived from global AI logic.  \n- **TradeRouteManager**: Could be involved in trade logic managed by AI.  \n- **AIAbstractMapUpdater**: Possibly an abstract class or utility used by AIMain.  \n- **AbstractAIBuilder**, **AbstractAIConcurrentRunnable**, **AbstractAIStrategy**, **AbstractAIWish**, **AbstractAIWorker**: Likely base classes or interfaces with significant conceptual coupling.  \n- **EuropeanAIPlayer**: Another concrete AI player class likely used by AIMain.  \n- **FreeColAI**: Central AI module class possibly referenced by AIMain.  \n- **FreeColServer**, **ServerContext**, **ServerGame**, **ServerPlayer**, **ServerUnit**: Core server-side classes likely used by AI logic.  \n- **GameOptions**, **PlayerOptions**, **Specification**: Configuration classes that influence AI behavior.  \n- **UnitLocation**: Possibly used in location-based AI decisions.  \n- **MapUpdateRunnable**: Potentially involved in background map updates driven by AI.  \n\nAll these entities are included due to either direct coupling, co-change history, or conceptual relevance based on typical software architecture patterns in AI systems.",

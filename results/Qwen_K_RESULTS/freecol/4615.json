Specifically, the following pattern is observed:\n\n```\n(Type Casting) (InGameController) getFreeColServer().getController()\n```\n\nThis indicates that `InGameInputHandler.java` performs type casting on the result of `getController()` obtained from `getFreeColServer()`, explicitly casting it to `InGameController`. This kind of dependency implies a tight coupling between these two files since one directly relies on the concrete implementation of the other.\n\n### Implications:\n- **Strong Technical Dependency:** The multiple instances of type casting suggest that changes in `InGameController` may directly affect how `InGameInputHandler` functions.\n- **Need for Synchronization:** If modifications are made to `InGameInputHandler.java`, it's highly likely that `InGameController.java` must also be reviewed or updated to maintain compatibility.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1.

Entities with higher confidence values indicate a stronger historical correlation between their changes and the changes to the starting entity.\n\n### Observations:\n- **Top Confidence:** The highest confidence is `0.3125` for `InGameController`, meaning in 5 out of 16 modifications, this file was changed together with `InGameInputHandler.java`. This suggests a strong dependency or functional relationship.\n- **Medium Confidence:** Files like `ServerModelController (0.1875)`, `TransportMission (0.125)`, `AIInGameInputHandler (0.125)`, and others show moderate confidence scores, indicating some recurring co-change patterns.\n- **Low Confidence:** Most files have a confidence score of `0.0625` or `0.125`, suggesting weaker or incidental relationships.\n\n### Next Steps:\nTo narrow down the list of entities that need synchronization, we can:\n1. Focus on files with high confidence (e.g., > 0.1).\n2. Use additional tools such as `get_coupling_dependencies` or `get_conceptual_coupling` to verify whether there are direct technical dependencies or semantic similarities with these files.\n\nLet me proceed by checking coupling dependencies between `InGameInputHandler.java` and `InGameController.java` (the most strongly correlated file). \n\n",

Specifically, the following pattern is observed:\n\n```\n(Type Casting) (InGameController) getFreeColServer().getController()\n```\n\nThis indicates that `InGameInputHandler.java` performs type casting on the result of `getController()` obtained from `getFreeColServer()`, explicitly casting it to `InGameController`. This kind of dependency implies a tight coupling between these two files since one directly relies on the concrete implementation of the other.\n\n### Implications:\n- **Strong Technical Dependency:** The multiple instances of type casting suggest that changes in `InGameController` may directly affect how `InGameInputHandler` functions.\n- **Need for Synchronization:** If modifications are made to `InGameInputHandler.java`, it's highly likely that `InGameController.java` must also be reviewed or updated to maintain compatibility.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. Analyze the conceptual coupling (semantic similarity) between these two files to better understand their functional relationship.\n2. Investigate further co-changed files with high confidence values such as `ServerModelController.java` and `TransportMission.java`.\n\nLet me first check the conceptual coupling between `InGameInputHandler.java` and `InGameController.java`.\n",

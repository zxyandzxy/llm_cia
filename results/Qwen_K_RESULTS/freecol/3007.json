However, their historical co-change relationship and high conceptual coupling suggest that changes in `NationCellRenderer.java` may influence `StartGamePanel.java`.\n\n### Summary of Findings\n\nBased on the analysis:\n\n- **Co-change Relationships**:\n  - `AdvantageCellRenderer.java` (support: 1, confidence: 1.0)\n  - `StartGamePanel.java` (support: 1, confidence: 1.0)\n\n- **Coupling Dependencies**:\n  - No direct coupling dependencies found for either entity with `NationCellRenderer.java`.\n\n- **Conceptual Coupling**:\n  - High semantic similarity:\n    - `AdvantageCellRenderer.java`: ~0.898\n    - `StartGamePanel.java`: ~0.846\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBoth `AdvantageCellRenderer.java` and `StartGamePanel.java` should be considered for synchronization with changes made to `NationCellRenderer.java`. This recommendation is based on their historical co-change relationships and high conceptual coupling, indicating potential functional or design interdependencies despite the lack of direct code-level dependencies.\n\nWould you like to proceed with further analysis of these files, such as inspecting their source code via the `get_origin_code` function?",

However, their historical co-change relationship and high conceptual coupling suggest that changes in `NationCellRenderer.java` may influence `StartGamePanel.java`.\n\n### Summary of Findings\n\nBased on the analysis:\n\n- **Co-change Relationships**:\n  - `AdvantageCellRenderer.java` (support: 1, confidence: 1.0)\n  - `StartGamePanel.java` (support: 1, confidence: 1.0)\n\n- **Coupling Dependencies**:\n  - No direct coupling dependencies found for either entity with `NationCellRenderer.java`.\n\n- **Conceptual Coupling**:\n  - High semantic similarity:\n    - `AdvantageCellRenderer.java`: ~0.898\n    - `StartGamePanel.java`: ~0.846\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBoth `AdvantageCellRenderer.java` and `StartGamePanel.java` should be considered for synchronization with changes made to `NationCellRenderer.java`. This recommendation is based on their historical co-change relationships and high conceptual coupling, indicating potential functional or design interdependencies despite the lack of direct code-level dependencies.\n\nWould you like to proceed with further analysis of these files, such as inspecting their source code via the `get_origin_code` function?",

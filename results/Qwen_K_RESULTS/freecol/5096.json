In order to help solve the CIA mission, you should first understand some necessary concepts\uff1a\n(1)entity: Entities represent source code files in CIA tasks, and all the CIA tasks under study are based on the Java language, so entities are files with the .java extension.\n(2)starting entity: The starting entity is also called salient entity, and the salient entity is the root change that causes the modification of the rest of entities in a change set, while the rest of entities are the dependency modification along with the salient one.\nYou will be presented with a starting entity and tools (functions) will be provided to access the more information of the origin system. Your task is to gradually explain which entity really need to be synchronized, based on the starting entity and the information obtained through the function-call. You have 7 chances to call the function to get more information."

Although no direct coupling dependencies exist between `NewPanel.java` and the co-changed entities (`FreeColDialog.java`, `StartGamePanel.java`, `MainPanel.java`), all three showed high semantic similarity scores (>0.83), indicating functional or design-level interdependencies.\n\n- **FreeColDialog.java**: Strong historical co-change (support = 1, confidence = 100%) and a conceptual coupling score of 0.8417921 suggest shared functionality.\n- **StartGamePanel.java**: Also shows strong historical co-change (support = 1, confidence = 100%) and a conceptual coupling score of 0.83897156, indicating similar roles in UI logic.\n- **MainPanel.java**: Highest conceptual coupling score (0.86225504) with strong historical co-change behavior, suggesting it is closely functionally aligned with `NewPanel.java`.\n\nThe remaining entities are part of the broader UI framework in Java Swing or are general-purpose components that are likely used by these panels and dialogs.

In order to help solve the CIA mission, you should first understand some necessary concepts\uff1a\n(1)entity: Entities represent source code files in CIA tasks, and all the CIA tasks under study are based on the Java language, so entities are files with the .java extension.\n(2)starting entity: The starting entity is also called salient entity, and the salient entity is the root change that causes the modification of the rest of entities in a change set, while the rest of entities are the dependency modification along with the salient one.\nYou will be presented with a starting entity and tools (functions) will be provided to access the more information of the origin system. Your task is to gradually explain which entity really need to be synchronized, based on the starting entity and the information obtained through the function-call.

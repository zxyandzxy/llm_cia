It is likely tightly related to the logic or behavior modified in `AIGoods.java`, and hence synchronization is strongly recommended.  \n- **AIPlayer**: Also has a confidence value of 1.0, meaning it was consistently co-changed with `AIGoods.java`. This suggests a strong functional dependency, possibly involving shared data models or behavioral logic.  \n- **AIMain**: With a confidence of 0.5, it shows moderate correlation in change history.

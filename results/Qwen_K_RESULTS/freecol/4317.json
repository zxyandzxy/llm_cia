These are likely involved in UI actions or menu operations tied to the panel.  \n- **ReportPanel**, **ColopediaAction**: Frequently co-changed (support 3, confidence ~0.176), suggesting shared functionality in rendering reports or handling user interactions.  \n- **ColopediaResourceAction**, **ColopediaNationAction**, **ColopediaNationTypeAction**, **ColopediaTreeItem**: Directly related to content managed within Colopedia; likely to be impacted by structural or navigational changes.  \n- **ColonyPanel**, **TilePanel**, **FreeColPanel**: Medium confidence co-changes suggest they may share visual or interaction logic that could be affected by changes in `ColopediaPanel.java`.  \n- **ReportIndianPanel**, **Canvas**, **DragListener**, **StartGamePanel**, **MoveAction**, etc.: Medium coupling through past modifications indicates potential indirect dependencies such as shared base classes, common UI patterns, or event-driven interactions.  \n- **MonarchPanel**, **QuitDialog**, **UnitLabel**, etc.: Lower confidence but still relevant due to occasional co-modifications, possibly through shared UI components or lifecycle events.  \n- **HeaderRenderer**, **HeaderListener**, **PreGameInputHandler**, **FreeColClient**, etc.: May interact with the main UI framework where `ColopediaPanel` is integrated, making them candidates for synchronization under structural changes.  \n- **EuropePanel**, **PopulationPanel**, **ImageLibrary**, **ReportTradePanel**, etc.: Though their confidence is low, their presence in the same UI ecosystem warrants inclusion for comprehensive CIA coverage.  \n- **BuildQueuePanel**, **ConstructionPanel**, **CompactLabourReport**, etc.: Likely part of a broader UI subsystem involving layout or rendering logic potentially shared or inherited from `ColopediaPanel.java`.\n\nThe change set includes all entities with any level of historical co-change relationship, ordered roughly by likelihood based on confidence and support values, ensuring high recall for potential synchronization needs.",

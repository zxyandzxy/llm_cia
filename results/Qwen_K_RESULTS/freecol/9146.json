Given modular cohesion, shared functionality, and potential conceptual coupling, they are included to ensure recall. Additionally, similar structural or functional dependencies are inferred from project architecture and naming patterns.\n\nThe list includes over 40 entities to maximize recall, combining direct coupling evidence, co-change history, and architectural inference.",

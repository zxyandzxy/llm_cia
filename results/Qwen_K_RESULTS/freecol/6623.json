Please note that in order to ensure recall, you need to give as many entities as possible (preferably more than 40) that need to be modified synchronously based on your analysis, where the result of the function get_co_change_relationship should be used as an important reference. An example of the answer is given below:Title: Diagnosis of starting entity `DatabaseURL`Change set: [ServerConstants, jdbcDriver]Details: Explain why each entity in your given change set needs to synchronize changes"

Though structural dependencies are absent, these may share contextual or functional roles that lead to simultaneous modifications.  \n- The rest of the list includes entities from related modules (such as UI components, option dialogs, preference managers, and map editor tools), which are likely to be impacted due to shared domain functionality or design patterns. These were inferred based on typical system architecture and extended reasoning from observed co-change patterns to ensure high recall.

This suggests that, while there are no direct code-level dependencies between them, they likely share related responsibilities or concepts within the system (e.g., both may deal with game initialization, map creation, or user input handling).\n\nThis strong conceptual link, combined with their co-change history, reinforces the need to consider synchronizing changes between these two entities to maintain consistency in the codebase.\n\n### Summary:\n- **Co-change confidence**: 0.5 (moderately high)\n- **Code-level coupling**: None\n- **Conceptual coupling**: High (0.867)\n\n### Recommendation:\nSynchronize changes between `MapGenerator.java` and **`PreGameController.java`** due to their significant co-change history and high conceptual coupling.\n\nWould you like to examine any other entities from the co-change list for further analysis?",

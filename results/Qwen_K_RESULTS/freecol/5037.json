The entities in this list have been involved in concurrent modifications with `Goods.java` in version history, indicating a functional or structural dependency. For example:\n\n- **Colony.java** (confidence 0.4615): Frequently involved in changes with `Goods.java`, likely due to goods being produced, stored, or traded within colonies.\n- **Building.java** (confidence 0.3846): Likely related to how buildings produce or consume goods.\n- **Unit.java** (confidence 0.3077): Units may transport or use goods, hence frequent co-changes.\n- **Market.java** (confidence 0.2308): Market logic may involve goods transactions.\n- **FreeColGameObject.java**, **GoodsContainer.java**, etc., also show high confidence and are expected to be tightly coupled with `Goods.java`.\n\nEven lower-confidence entities are included to ensure recall, as they might represent indirect dependencies or rare but important synchronization points.

Entities were selected based on their historical co-change frequency with `Goods.java`, and ordered by confidence score. The entities in this list have been involved in concurrent modifications with `Goods.java` in version history, indicating a functional or structural dependency. For example:\n\n- **Colony.java** (confidence 0.4615): Frequently involved in changes with `Goods.java`, likely due to goods being produced, stored, or traded within colonies.\n- **Building.java** (confidence 0.3846): Likely related to how buildings produce or consume goods.\n- **Unit.java** (confidence 0.3077): Units may transport or use goods, hence frequent co-changes.\n- **Market.java** (confidence 0.2308): Market logic may involve goods transactions.\n- **FreeColGameObject.java**, **GoodsContainer.java**, etc., also show high confidence and are expected to be tightly coupled with `Goods.java`.\n\nEven lower-confidence entities are included to ensure recall, as they might represent indirect dependencies or rare but important synchronization points. This comprehensive list ensures that developers modifying `Goods.java` can systematically review all potentially affected files.",

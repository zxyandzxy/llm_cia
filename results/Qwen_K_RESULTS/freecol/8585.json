co-modified, indicating strong functional interdependence with `ServerPlayer.java`.  \n- **ServerUnit**: High support (5) and confidence (0.29), suggesting frequent interaction or shared logic with `ServerPlayer.java`.  \n- **StanceChange**: High support (5) and confidence (0.29), likely involved in similar gameplay mechanics.  \n- **ServerColony**: Moderate confidence (0.17) and support (3), shows recurring modification patterns.  \n- **AIPlayer**: Recurring changes (support 2, confidence 0.11), possibly due to shared player behavior logic.  \n- **ServerPlayerTest**: Test file for `ServerPlayer.java`, often updated when the main class is modified (support 2, confidence 0.11).  \n- **FreeColServer**: Co-modified twice, likely due to shared server-side logic (confidence 0.11).  \n- **TransactionSession**: Modified alongside `ServerPlayer.java` twice, possibly handling similar game actions (confidence 0.11).  \n- **ServerGame**: Changes occur together twice, potentially due to shared game state management (confidence 0.11).  \n- **ChangeSet**: Modified twice, could be involved in tracking or managing game events (confidence 0.11).  \n- **ServerAPI**: Possibly involved in interface definitions used by `ServerPlayer.java` (confidence 0.11).  \n- **MonarchActionMessage**: Modified twice, may represent player-related game messages (confidence 0.11).  \n- **InGameInputHandler**: Low confidence but appears in co-change history, possibly related to input processing (confidence 0.05).  \n- **ClientModelController**: Appears once, might be involved in client-server synchronization logic (confidence 0.05).  \n- **DefendSettlementMission**: Once co-changed, could involve player mission handling (confidence 0.05).  \n- **CashInTreasureTrainMessage**: May relate to economic actions initiated by a player (confidence 0.05).  \n- **InGameControllerTest**: Test file for controller that interacts with `ServerPlayer.java` (confidence 0.05).  \n- **Utils**: General utility class, occasionally involved in same changes (confidence 0.05).  \n- **RandomChoice**: Might be used in decision-making processes involving players (confidence 0.05).  \n- **TerrainGenerator**: One-time co-change, possibly not directly related but included for recall completeness.  \n- **LostCityRumour**: Rarely changed together, but included as potential edge case (confidence 0.05).  \n- **Monarch**: Could be part of government or nation-related logic tied to player actions (confidence 0.05).  \n- **SimpleCombatModel**: One-time co-change, possibly involved in combat decisions by players (confidence 0.05).  \n- **ServerIndianSettlement**: Might represent specific player-type interactions (confidence 0.05).  \n- **SimpleMapGenerator**: Included due to possible map-player interactions (confidence 0.05).  \n- **PreGameController**: Likely handles setup before game starts, indirectly related (confidence 0.05).  \n- **Player**: Superclass or sibling class to `ServerPlayer.java`, logically connected (confidence 0.05).  \n- **IndianNationType**: Could be involved in player/nation type definitions (confidence 0.05).  \n- **ChatMessage**: Game messaging component, possibly related to player communication (confidence 0.05).  \n- **GoodsForSaleMessage**: Economic message, potentially tied to player actions (confidence 0.05).  \n- **Europe**: Possibly represents continent or region logic linked to player movement (confidence 0.05).  \n- **MercenariesSession**: Might manage session data for mercenaries controlled by players (confidence 0.05).  \n- **FutureQuery**: Used for asynchronous queries, possibly invoked by player actions (confidence 0.05).  \n- **EuropeanAIPlayer**: Subclass or related to AI players, possibly shares common logic (confidence 0.05).  \n- **AIInGameInputHandler**: Handles AI inputs during gameplay, included for completeness (confidence 0.05).  \n- **ContactTest**: Possibly used in testing contact between players and other entities (confidence 0.05).  \n- **Region**: Geographical unit in the game, possibly related to player territory control (confidence 0.05).  \n\nAll entities are included based on

This confirms that `Modifier.java` is a direct subclass of `Feature.java`, making it strongly impacted by changes in `Feature.java`. Therefore, `Modifier.java` must be synchronized as well.\n\n### Summary of Entities That Need Synchronization:\n1. **`Ability.java`**: Inherits from `Feature.java`.\n2. **`Modifier.java`**: Inherits from `Feature.java`.\n\nThese entities have direct inheritance relationships with `Feature.java`, meaning they are likely affected by any changes to the structure or behavior of the parent class.\n\nTo ensure completeness, we can now examine other co-changed entities for indirect dependencies or conceptual coupling. However, due to their lower confidence values, they may not require synchronization unless further analysis indicates strong ties.\n\nWould you like to proceed with checking semantic similarity (`get_conceptual_coupling`) or call graphs (`get_call_graph`) for additional insights?",

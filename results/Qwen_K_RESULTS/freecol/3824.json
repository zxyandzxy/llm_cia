In CIA, these co-change relationships are significant because they indicate the entities that are likely to be impacted by or related to changes in the starting entity.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the top entities with high confidence scores:\n1. **GUI.java** (Support: 11, Confidence: ~32.35%): This indicates a strong relationship as it appears alongside `ImageLibrary.java` quite frequently.\n2. **Canvas.java** and **TilePanel.java** (Support: 5 each, Confidence: ~14.71%): These also show relatively higher co-change occurrences.\n3. **MiniMap.java** and **MapControls.java** (Support: 4 each, Confidence: ~11.76%): These entities also exhibit moderate coupling.\n\nAdditionally, several entities like **IndianSettlement.java**, **ZoomInAction.java**, etc., appear with lower support and confidence scores, suggesting weaker or more incidental relationships.\n\nGiven this data, we should focus on further analyzing the relationships between `ImageLibrary.java` and those entities with higher confidence scores (e.g., `GUI.java`, `Canvas.java`, `TilePanel.java`) to determine whether there are direct dependencies or conceptual couplings.\n\nNext, I will analyze the **conceptual coupling** between `ImageLibrary.java` and `GUI.java` using the `get_conceptual_coupling` function to evaluate semantic similarity. \n\nWould you like me to proceed?",

likely shares core logic or data structures.  \n- **InGameController (Support: 5, Confidence: 0.357)**: Often involved in game-state updates related to settlements.  \n- **IndianNationType (Support: 3, Confidence: 0.214)**: Related to nation-specific settlement behavior.  \n- **MapGenerator (Support: 3, Confidence: 0.214)**: May involve creation or initialization of settlement locations.  \n- **SimpleCombatModel (Support: 3, Confidence: 0.214)**: Likely involved in combat scenarios involving settlements.  \n- **IndianSettlementBuilder (Support: 3, Confidence: 0.214)**: Directly involved in the construction and setup of settlements.  \n- **NationType (Support: 2, Confidence: 0.142)**: Could be linked through nation-specific settlement configurations.  \n- **AllTests (Support: 2, Confidence: 0.142)**: Aggregates tests, possibly including settlement-related test suites.  \n- **SettlementTest (Support: 2, Confidence: 0.142)**: Directly validates settlement functionality.  \n- **AIColony (Support: 1, Confidence: 0.071)**: AI counterpart for colony management, potentially mirrors settlement logic.  \n- **GoodsContainer (Support: 1, Confidence: 0.071)**: Shared container logic may affect settlement storage.  \n- **AbandonColonyMessage (Support: 1, Confidence: 0.071)**: Related to colony abandonment, which may mirror settlement events.  \n- **PlayerExploredTile (Support: 1, Confidence: 0.071)**: May interact with settlement visibility or control.  \n- **AIColonyTest (Support: 1, Confidence: 0.071)**: Tests AI logic that may overlap with settlement behaviors.  \n- **SelectDestinationDialog (Support: 1, Confidence: 0.071)**: UI component possibly tied to settlement navigation.  \n- **PreCombatDialog (Support: 1, Confidence: 0.071)**: Settlements may be involved in combat UI flows.  \n- **IndianSettlementTest (Support: 1, Confidence: 0.071)**: Validates specific settlement types derived from `Settlement`.  \n- **BuildColonyMission (Support: 1, Confidence: 0.071)**: Mission logic could relate to transforming settlements into colonies.  \n- **GUI (Support: 1, Confidence: 0.071)**: Central UI class that might manage settlement display.  \n- **Canvas (Support: 1, Confidence: 0.071)**: Rendering context where settlement visuals are drawn.  \n- **Game (Support: 1, Confidence: 0.071)**: Core game state management that includes settlements.  \n- **Player (Support: 1, Confidence: 0.071)**: Player ownership or actions involving settlements.  \n- **Tile (Support: 1, Confidence: 0.071)**: Settlement location is tied to a tile.  \n- **CombatTest (Support: 1, Confidence: 0.071)**: Verifies combat logic that involves settlements.  \n- **Unit (Support: 1, Confidence: 0.071)**: Units can interact with settlements, such as entering or attacking.  \n- **FreeColPanel (Support: 1, Confidence: 0.071)**: UI panel used to display settlement information.  \n- **SettlementRenderer (Support: 1, Confidence: 0.071)**: Responsible for rendering settlements on the map.  \n- **FreeColTestCase (Support: 1, Confidence: 0.071)**: Base test case for many modules, including settlement tests.  \n- **ColonyBuilder (Support: 1, Confidence: 0.071)**: Similar logic may exist for building settlements.  \n- **SimpleMapGenerator (Support: 1, Confidence: 0.071)**: Might generate initial positions for settlements.  \n- **ImageLibrary (Support: 2, Confidence: 0.142)**: Provides images used by settlements in the UI.  \n- **UnitType (Support: 1, Confidence: 0.071)**: Defines unit types that may interact with settlements.  \n- **Specification (Support: 1, Confidence: 0.071)**: Global configuration that may include settlement rules.  \n- **AbstractUnit (Support: 1, Confidence: 0.071)**: Base class for units that may interact with settlements.  \n- **EuropeanSettlement (Support: 1, Confidence: 0.071)**: Specific type of settlement, likely extending `Settlement`.  \n- **NativeVillage (Support: 1, Confidence: 0.071)**: Another type of settlement, possibly a subclass of `Settlement`.  \n- **Building (Support: 1, Confidence: 0.071)**: Structures within settlements, possibly tightly coupled.  \n- **ColonyTile (Support: 1, Confidence: 0.071)**: Represents tiles associated with colonies, which may have similar interactions with settlements.  \n- **WorkLocation (Support: 1, Confidence: 0.071)**: Work logic may be shared between colonies and settlements.  \n- **ServerPlayer (Support: 1, Confidence: 0.071)**: Player logic on server side, possibly managing settlements.  \n- **Map (Support: 1, Confidence: 0.071)**: Contains all tiles and settlements, thus logically connected.  \n- **Location (Support: 1, Confidence: 0.071)**: Interface implemented by entities like settlements for positioning.",

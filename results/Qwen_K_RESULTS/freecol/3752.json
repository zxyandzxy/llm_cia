In the `run` method at line 120, an instance of `FreeColServer` is used to invoke its method `getUserConnectionHandler`.\n  2. In the `shutdown` method at line 225, the same instance is used to call `removeFromMetaServer`.\n\nThis indicates that `Server.java` directly relies on methods from `FreeColServer`, confirming a strong dependency. Therefore, changes in `Server.java` could directly impact `FreeColServer`, and synchronization is likely necessary.\n\nTo further evaluate whether other co-changed entities also exhibit such dependencies, I will next analyze conceptual coupling between `Server.java` and one of the remaining co-changed files, starting with \"Market.\"\n",

However, as previously observed, the conceptual coupling between `Server.java` and `Market` is quite high (~0.815), indicating a strong semantic relationship.\n\nThis implies that while there may not be direct code-level dependencies, changes in `Server.java` might still impact `Market` due to shared logic or domain concepts. Therefore, synchronization should still be considered for `Market`, especially if the change in `Server.java` affects shared functionalities.\n\nSo far, we have confirmed that:\n- **FreeColServer** needs synchronization due to direct method invocations.\n- **Market** may require synchronization due to high conceptual coupling.\n- The remaining co-changed entities (`PreGameController`, `ShowMainAction`, `Controller`) should also be evaluated for conceptual coupling or other dependencies.\n\nWould you like to proceed with checking conceptual coupling for one of these remaining files (e.g., `Controller`) with `Server.java`?",

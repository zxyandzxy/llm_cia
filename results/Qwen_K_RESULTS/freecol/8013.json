In order to help solve the CIA mission, you should first understand some necessary concepts\uff1a\n(1)entity: Entities represent source code files in CIA tasks, and all the CIA tasks under study are based on the Java language, so entities are files with the .java extension.\n(2)starting entity: The starting entity is also called salient entity, and the salient entity is the root change that causes the modification of the rest of entities in a change set, while the rest of entities are the dependency modification along with the salient one.\nYou will be presented with a starting entity and tools (functions) will be provided to access the more information of the origin system. Your task is to gradually explain which entity really need to be synchronized, based on the starting entity and the information obtained through the function-call. You have 7 chances to call the function to get more information."

                "content": "Similar to the previous cases, the result shows that:\n\n- `IndianDemandMission` extends `Mission.java`.\n\nThis confirms that `IndianDemandMission` is also a subclass of `Mission.java`, which means it inherently depends on its superclass both structurally and likely semantically.\n\nGiven this inheritance relationship, **`IndianDemandMission` should also be synchronized** when changes are made to `Mission.java`.\n\n### General Pattern Observed:\nFrom the analysis so far, we can observe a consistent pattern:\n1. The top co-changed entities with high confidence scores are all **subclasses of `Mission.java`**.\n2. Inheritance implies strong coupling, meaning changes in the superclass may propagate to subclasses.\n3. High semantic similarity further supports shared functionality or concerns between these classes.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBased on the co-change history, structural dependencies (inheritance), and conceptual coupling, the following entities need to be considered for synchronization when `Mission.java` is changed:\n\n- `UnitSeekAndDestroyMission`\n- `TransportMission`\n- `IndianDemandMission`\n- Other subclasses of `Mission.java` (e.g., `UnitWanderHostileMission`, `DefendSettlementMission`, etc.)\n\nThese files should be reviewed and potentially updated whenever a change occurs in `Mission.java`.\n\nWould you like me to generate a final list of all such impacted entities, or proceed with analyzing any specific entity further?",

Please note that in order to ensure recall, you need to give as many entities as possible (preferably more than 40) that need to be modified synchronously based on your analysis, where the result of the function get_co_change_relationship should be used as an important reference.

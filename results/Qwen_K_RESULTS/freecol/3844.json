The confidence levels indicate the likelihood these entities should be synchronized based on prior change patterns.\n\nHere are some notable entities with higher confidence scores:\n\n- **GUI.java** (confidence: ~0.32)\n- **Canvas.java** (confidence: ~0.147)\n- **TilePanel.java** (confidence: ~0.147)\n- **MiniMap.java** (confidence: ~0.117)\n- **MapControls.java** (confidence: ~0.117)\n\nTo further determine which of these entities need synchronization, we can consider analyzing the coupling dependencies between `ImageLibrary.java` and each of these entities. This will provide insights into how tightly they are related through direct code dependencies.\n\nWould you like to proceed by checking the coupling dependencies between `ImageLibrary.java` and one or more of these files?",

Please note that in order to ensure recall, you need to give as many entities as possible (preferably more than 40) that need to be modified synchronously based on your analysis, where the result of the function get_co_change_relationship should be used as an important reference.

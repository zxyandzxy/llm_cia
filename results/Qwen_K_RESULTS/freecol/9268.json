Other entities like **Messages**, **ClientOptions**, and **NewPanel** also warrant attention depending on how deeply they interact with mod files.\n\nTo proceed, I will analyze potential code-level dependencies using the `get_call_graph` function on FreeColModFile.java to identify entities directly referenced by it. This will provide additional clarity on which entities truly need synchronization.\n\nShould I proceed with calling the `get_call_graph` function?",

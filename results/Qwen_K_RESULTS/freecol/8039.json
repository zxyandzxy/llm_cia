Starting with key files showing higher confidence/support, such as `EuropePanel.java` and `CargoPanel.java`, would be logical.\n\nWould you like me to proceed by checking coupling dependencies for any specific entity?",

Here are some observations:\n\n1. **High Confidence & Support:**\n   - `EuropePanel.java` has a high support of 10 and confidence of ~47.6%.\n   - `CargoPanel.java` has the highest support of 6 and confidence of ~28.6%.\n   - `DragListener.java` and `UnitLabel.java` both show a support of 5 and confidence of ~23.8%.\n\n2. **Moderate Confidence & Support:**\n   - Entities like `FreeColDialog.java`, `DefaultTransferHandler.java`, and others show moderate confidence (~14.3%) with lower support.\n\n3. **Low Confidence & Support:**\n   - A majority of the other files exhibit low confidence (e.g., ~4.76%) and minimal support, indicating weaker historical correlation in modifications.\n\n### Next Steps:\nTo refine our CIA mission further, I recommend analyzing the coupling dependencies between `ColonyPanel.java` and these co-changed files to determine which ones are directly or semantically linked. Starting with key files showing higher confidence/support, such as `EuropePanel.java` and `CargoPanel.java`, would be logical.\n\nWould you like me to proceed by checking coupling dependencies for any specific entity?",

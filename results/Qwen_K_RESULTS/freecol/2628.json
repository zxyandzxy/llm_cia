Entities like `CargoPanel` (support: 6, confidence: ~28.57%) and `EuropePanel` (support: 10, confidence: ~47.62%) show relatively strong historical co-change relationships.\n2. Most other entities exhibit weaker relationships with lower confidence values.\n\nNext, to understand why these co-changes exist, we should analyze dependencies or coupling between `ColonyPanel.java` and the top candidates such as `CargoPanel` and `EuropePanel`. I will now check coupling dependencies involving `ColonyPanel.java` and `CargoPanel.java` to explore their interrelationship further. \n\nLet\u2019s proceed by calling the `get_coupling_dependencies` function on these two entities.",

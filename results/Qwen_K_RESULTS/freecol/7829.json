Developers may frequently modify both files together because they serve related purposes in the system, even if they don't directly reference each other in the code.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- **Synchronization Consideration:** Since `Canvas` is conceptually closely related to `FreeColDialog.java`, it should be considered for synchronization during changes, especially when modifications involve shared functionality or user interface aspects.\n- The combined evidence from co-change history and conceptual coupling supports this decision.\n\nWould you like me to analyze any other relationships or proceed with analyzing another entity from the co-change list?",

This will help determine if there's a meaningful overlap in their functionalities or purposes from a natural language perspective.\n\nLet me proceed with calling the `get_conceptual_coupling` function for these two entities.\n",

Developers may frequently modify both files together because they serve related purposes in the system, even if they don't directly reference each other in the code.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- **Synchronization Consideration:** Since `Canvas` is conceptually closely related to `FreeColDialog.java`, it should be considered for synchronization during changes, especially when modifications involve shared functionality or user interface aspects.\n- The combined evidence from co-change history and conceptual coupling supports this decision.\n\nWould you like me to analyze any other relationships or proceed with analyzing another entity from the co-change list?",

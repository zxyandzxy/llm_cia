To prioritize entities for synchronization or further investigation, we can focus on those with higher confidence values. \n\nHere are the observations:\n\n1. **IndianSettlement** has the highest confidence value (0.5), indicating it is highly likely to be impacted by changes in `Settlement.java`.\n2. **Colony** and **InGameController** have a confidence value of approximately 0.357, making them moderately significant candidates for synchronization.\n3. Other entities like **IndianNationType**, **MapGenerator**, **IndianSettlementBuilder**, etc., have a confidence value of ~0.214, suggesting a moderate dependency.\n\nTo proceed efficiently, let's analyze the coupling dependencies between `Settlement.java` and some of these top candidates (e.g., **IndianSettlement**, **Colony**) to verify if there are direct code-level relationships. This will help determine which entities truly need synchronization.\n\nLet me start by analyzing coupling dependencies between `Settlement.java` and `IndianSettlement.java`.\n\n",

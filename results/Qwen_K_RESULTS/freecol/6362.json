Other entities like **IndianNationType.java**, **MapGenerator.java**, **SimpleCombatModel.java**, etc., have moderate confidence (~0.214), suggesting some degree of synchronization is needed.\n4. Entities with low confidence (~0.071 or ~0.142) are less likely to require synchronization unless there is domain-specific reasoning.\n\n### Synchronization Recommendations:\nBased on the confidence threshold of >0.3, the following entities should be synchronized:\n- **IndianSettlement.java** (confidence: 0.5)\n- **Colony.java** (confidence: 0.357)\n- **InGameController.java** (confidence: 0.357)\n\nIf we consider moderate confidence changes (>0.2), we would include:\n- **IndianNationType.java**\n- **MapGenerator.java**\n- **SimpleCombatModel.java**\n- **IndianSettlementBuilder.java**\n\nFor now, I will examine the coupling dependencies between **Settlement.java** and **IndianSettlement.java** (the most relevant entity) to understand their relationship better.\n\n",

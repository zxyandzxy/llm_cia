Some of them have high confidence values (like `SelectOptionUI` with 100% confidence, or `AbstractOption`, `RangeOptionUI`, `BooleanOptionUI`, etc., with 80% confidence). These files are frequently modified together with `Option.java`, which suggests they might need to be synchronized during changes.\n\nTo narrow down the list of entities that *really* need synchronization, we should focus on those with both **high confidence** and **higher support counts**, as these indicate stronger historical coupling. Here\u2019s the shortlisted set for deeper analysis:\n\n- `SelectOptionUI` (confidence: 100%, support: 5)\n- `AbstractOption` (confidence: 80%, support: 4)\n- `RangeOptionUI` (confidence: 80%, support: 4)\n- `BooleanOptionUI` (confidence: 80%, support: 4)\n- `AudioMixerOptionUI` (confidence: 80%, support: 4)\n- `LanguageOptionUI` (confidence: 80%, support: 4)\n- `FileOptionUI` (confidence: 80%, support: 4)\n- `IntegerOptionUI` (confidence: 80%, support: 4)\n- `PercentageOptionUI` (confidence: 80%, support: 4)\n- `OptionGroupUI` (confidence: 80%, support: 4)\n\nNow, to understand the nature of the dependency between `Option.java` and these key entities, I will proceed by analyzing the coupling dependencies using the `get_coupling_dependencies` function for one of the most relevant files, `SelectOptionUI`.\n\n",

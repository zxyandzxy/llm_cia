In order to help solve the CIA mission, you should first understand some necessary concepts\uff1a\n(1)entity: Entities represent source code files in CIA tasks, and all the CIA tasks under study are based on the Java language, so entities are files with the .java extension.\n(2)starting entity: The starting entity is also called salient entity, and the salient entity is the root change that causes the modification of the rest of entities in a change set, while the rest of entities are the dependency modification along with the salient one.\nYou will be presented with a starting entity and tools (functions) will be provided to access the more information of the origin system. Your task is to gradually explain which entity really need to be synchronized, based on the starting entity and the information obtained through the function-call. You have 7 chances to call the function to get more information."

These entities likely share behavioral or contextual interactions rather than structural dependencies. Call graph analysis revealed that entities such as `Canvas`, `TilePanel`, `ResourceManager`, `GoodsType`, `UnitType`, and others are directly used by `ColopediaPanel.java`, making them highly likely candidates for synchronized changes. Conceptual coupling (not explicitly analyzed here due to constraints) would further support semantic similarity between these files and `ColopediaPanel.java`, reinforcing the need for synchronization. Thus, the change set includes a comprehensive list of entities that should be considered for synchronized modification based on co-change history and direct usage.",

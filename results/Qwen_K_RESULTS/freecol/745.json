In order to help solve the CIA mission, you should first understand some necessary concepts\uff1a\n(1)entity: Entities represent source code files in CIA tasks, and all the CIA tasks under study are based on the Java language, so entities are files with the .java extension.\n(2)starting entity: The starting entity is also called salient entity, and the salient entity is the root change that causes the modification of the rest of entities in a change set, while the rest of entities are the dependency modification along with the salient one.\nYou will be presented with a starting entity and tools (functions) will be provided to access the more information of the origin system. Your task is to gradually explain which entity really need to be synchronized, based on the starting entity and the information obtained through the function-call. You have 7 chances to call the function to get more information."

This confirms that these two entities are semantically very similar and likely share overlapping responsibilities\u2014possibly in the loading, caching, or providing of image resources.\n\nGiven this information, here is a summary of what we\u2019ve found so far:\n\n### Key Findings:\n1. **Co-change Relationships:**\n   - `ImageLibrary.java` has a strong historical co-change relationship with several GUI-related components.\n   - The strongest co-change is with `GUI.java` (support: 11, confidence: ~32%).\n\n2. **Coupling Analysis:**\n   - No direct structural coupling exists between `ImageLibrary.java` and `GUI.java`.\n   - However, there is **strong conceptual coupling**, indicating shared semantics or functional overlap.\n\n3. **Call Graph:**\n   - `ImageLibrary.java` interacts directly with many core game entities such as `Tile`, `Unit`, `Colony`, etc., suggesting it provides visual assets for these objects.\n   - It also uses `ImageProvider.java`, reinforcing their close functional relationship.\n\n4. **Conceptual Coupling Highlights:**\n   - `ImageLibrary.java` is conceptually very close to both `GUI.java` and `ImageProvider.java`.\n\n---\n\n### Entities Likely Affected by Changes to `ImageLibrary.java`:\nBased on the analysis, the following entities should be considered for synchronization when `ImageLibrary.java` changes:\n\n- \u2705 **GUI.java** \u2013 High co-change and semantic similarity.\n- \u2705 **ImageProvider.java** \u2013 Strong conceptual and likely functional ties.\n- \u2705 **Canvas.java**, **TilePanel.java**, **MiniMap.java**, **MapControls.java** \u2013 High co-change support/confidence.\n- \u2705 **ActionManager.java**, **ZoomInAction.java**, **ZoomOutAction.java**, **MapEditorTransformPanel.java**, **ColopediaPanel.java** \u2013 Moderate co-change frequency.\n\nThese entities should be reviewed or tested when changes are made to `ImageLibrary.java`.\n\nWould you like me to proceed further by retrieving the source code of any specific file (e.g., `ImageLibrary.java` or `GUI.java`) to provide more detailed insights into their implementation?",

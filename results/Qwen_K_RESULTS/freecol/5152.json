These entities may collaborate in a loosely coupled manner, possibly through event-driven communication, message passing, or some form of indirect interaction not captured by static dependency analysis.\n\nTo better understand the nature of this relationship, we could either:\n1. Examine the **call graph** of `ChatMessage.java` to identify entities it interacts with directly.\n2. Analyze the **conceptual coupling** (semantic similarity) between `ChatMessage.java` and these co-changed files to see if they share similar concerns or responsibilities.\n\nWould you like to proceed with analyzing the **call graph** of `ChatMessage.java`, or should we examine **conceptual coupling** instead?",

These entities may collaborate in a loosely coupled manner, possibly through event-driven communication, message passing, or some form of indirect interaction not captured by static dependency analysis.\n\nTo better understand the nature of this relationship, we could either:\n1. Examine the **call graph** of `ChatMessage.java` to identify entities it interacts with directly.\n2. Analyze the **conceptual coupling** (semantic similarity) between `ChatMessage.java` and these co-changed files to see if they share similar concerns or responsibilities.\n\nWould you like to proceed with analyzing the **call graph** of `ChatMessage.java`, or should we examine **conceptual coupling** instead?",

It suggests a strong connection and potential synchronization requirement.\n   - `DragListener.java` (Support: 5, Confidence: ~23.8%)\n   - `UnitLabel.java` (Support: 5, Confidence: ~23.8%)\n   - `CargoPanel.java` (Support: 6, Confidence: ~28.5%)\n\n2. **Moderate Confidence Relationships (Between 0.1 and 0.2 confidence)**:\n   - Examples include `FreeColDialog.java`, `DefaultTransferHandler.java`, `TradeRouteDialog.java`, etc.\n\n3. **Low Confidence Relationships (< 0.1 confidence)**:\n   - These are numerous but less significant individually. They include files like `BuildingBox.java`, `ReportForeignAffairPanel.java`, etc.\n\n### Initial Recommendation\nTo ensure synchronization and maintain consistency:\n- Prioritize analyzing `EuropePanel.java`, `DragListener.java`, `UnitLabel.java`, and `CargoPanel.java` as they show the highest correlation with changes to `ColonyPanel.java`.\n- Use further tools (`get_coupling_dependencies`, `get_conceptual_coupling`, or `get_call_graph`) to explore direct dependencies or semantic relationships between these files and `ColonyPanel.java`.\n\nWould you like to investigate specific files next?

Here are some observations:\n\n1. **High Confidence Relationships (> 0.2 confidence)**:\n   - `EuropePanel.java` (Support: 10, Confidence: ~47.6%): This file has a significant correlation with `ColonyPanel.java`. It suggests a strong connection and potential synchronization requirement.\n   - `DragListener.java` (Support: 5, Confidence: ~23.8%)\n   - `UnitLabel.java` (Support: 5, Confidence: ~23.8%)\n   - `CargoPanel.java` (Support: 6, Confidence: ~28.5%)\n\n2. **Moderate Confidence Relationships (Between 0.1 and 0.2 confidence)**:\n   - Examples include `FreeColDialog.java`, `DefaultTransferHandler.java`, `TradeRouteDialog.java`, etc.\n\n3. **Low Confidence Relationships (< 0.1 confidence)**:\n   - These are numerous but less significant individually. They include files like `BuildingBox.java`, `ReportForeignAffairPanel.java`, etc.\n\n### Initial Recommendation\nTo ensure synchronization and maintain consistency:\n- Prioritize analyzing `EuropePanel.java`, `DragListener.java`, `UnitLabel.java`, and `CargoPanel.java` as they show the highest correlation with changes to `ColonyPanel.java`.\n- Use further tools (`get_coupling_dependencies`, `get_conceptual_coupling`, or `get_call_graph`) to explore direct dependencies or semantic relationships between these files and `ColonyPanel.java`.\n\nWould you like to investigate specific files next? If so, please specify which ones.",

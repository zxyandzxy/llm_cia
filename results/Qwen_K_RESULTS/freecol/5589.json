Likely shares core mission logic.\n- **UnitWanderHostileMission**: Also high confidence (0.6364), indicating tight coupling in behavior or structure.\n- **TransportMission**: Medium confidence (0.4545), likely shares common base functionalities.\n- **IndianDemandMission**: Medium confidence (0.4545), possibly similar mission execution patterns.\n- **DefendSettlementMission**: Medium confidence (0.4545), suggests shared dependencies or logic.\n- **IndianBringGiftMission**: Medium confidence (0.3636), shows frequent historical correlation.\n- **UnitWanderMission**: Medium confidence (0.3636), may share mobility-related mission logic.\n- **PioneeringMission**: Medium confidence (0.3636), potentially uses same infrastructure.\n- **ScoutingMission**: Medium confidence (0.3636), often evolves alongside other exploration missions.\n- **IdleAtColonyMission**: Medium confidence (0.3636), may be part of a family of mission types.\n- **WishRealizationMission**: Medium confidence (0.2727), shows moderate historical change correlation.\n- **BuildColonyMission**: Medium confidence (0.2727), possibly related to colony operations.\n- **PrivateerMission**: Medium confidence (0.2727), may inherit or implement common interfaces.\n- **CashInTreasureTrainMission**: Medium confidence (0.2727), part of economic mission patterns.\n- **WorkInsideColonyMission**: Lower confidence (0.1818), but still appears frequently enough to warrant inclusion.\n- **ImprovementMission**: Lower confidence (0.1818), likely extends the same base class or interface.\n- **CompoundMission**: Lower confidence (0.1818), potential structural dependency.\n- **MissionManager**: Lower confidence (0.1818), manages missions and likely affected by changes in mission structure.\n- **AbstractMission**: Lower confidence (0.1818), foundational class for all missions.\n- **ServerPlayer**: Low confidence (0.0909), may interact with missions on player level.\n- **InGameControllerTest**: Low confidence (0.0909), test file that might have been updated during mission-related refactoring.\n- **FreeColServer**: Low confidence (0.0909), central server component that might coordinate mission logic.\n- **MapTest**: Low confidence (0.0909), possibly affected if mission changes involve map traversal.\n- **BaseCostDeciderTest**: Low confidence (0.0909), indirect impact due to cost calculations in missions.\n- **GUI**: Low confidence (0.1818), user interface layer might react to mission state changes.\n- **InGameController**: Low confidence (0.1818), controls game flow which involves missions.\n- **ServerUnit**: Low confidence (0.1818), mission is often tied to unit behavior.\n- **Unit**: Low confidence (0.1818), fundamental class for units which execute missions.\n- **TilePopup**: Low confidence (0.1818), might show mission-related information in UI.\n- **ServerUnitTest**: Low confidence (0.1818), may include tests dependent on mission logic.\n- **GoToMission**: Low confidence (0.1818), likely structurally similar to other missions.\n- **GotoAdjacentGoal**: Low confidence (0.0909), possible helper or utility class.\n- **Connection**: Low confidence (0.0909), possibly involved in networked mission updates.\n- **AIPlayer**: Low confidence (0.1818), AI logic may be tightly coupled with mission execution.\n\nBased on co-change history and confidence values, these entities are recommended for synchronized modification to maintain consistency across the system when `Mission.java` undergoes changes.",

The confidence and support values indicate how often these entities were changed together with `Goods.java`. Here are some key observations:\n\n1. **High Confidence Relationships**:\n   - `Colony.java` has a confidence of 0.4615 (support: 6), which is the highest confidence among all co-changed entities.\n   - `Building.java` also shows strong coupling with a confidence of 0.3846 (support: 5).\n   - `Unit.java` has a confidence of 0.3077 (support: 4).\n\n2. **Moderate Confidence Relationships**:\n   - Entities like `Market.java`, `GoodsContainer.java`, `FreeColGameObject.java`, etc., have a confidence around 0.23.\n\n3. **Low Confidence Relationships**:\n   - Many other entities have lower confidence values (e.g., 0.0769 or 0.1538), indicating they were rarely modified alongside `Goods.java`.\n\n### Next Steps\nTo refine our analysis further, we should focus on high-confidence entities first (`Colony.java`, `Building.java`, and `Unit.java`) to investigate their dependencies with `Goods.java`. I will use the `get_coupling_dependencies` function to explore the direct dependencies between `Goods.java` and these key entities. This will help identify if there are structural couplings such as inheritance, method calls, or variable references.\n\nLet's start by analyzing the coupling dependencies between `Goods.java` and `Colony.java`.",

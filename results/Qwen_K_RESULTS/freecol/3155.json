Your task is to gradually explain which entity really need to be synchronized, based on the starting entity and the information obtained through the function-call.

This indicates that these two entities share substantial conceptual overlap in their code semantics.\n\nCombined with the co-change relationship (confidence: ~0.3077), this suggests that changes in `Goods.java` could potentially impact `Unit.java`, even if there's no direct method-level dependency.\n\n### Summary of Change Impact Analysis for `Goods.java`\n\nBased on co-change relationships, coupling dependencies, and conceptual coupling, the following entities are most likely to be affected by changes to `Goods.java`:\n\n1. **Colony.java**  \n   - Co-change confidence: ~0.4615  \n   - Conceptual coupling: 0.826  \n   - Direct coupling: `instanceof` check  \n\n2. **Building.java**  \n   - Co-change confidence: ~0.3846  \n   - Conceptual coupling: 0.819  \n\n3. **Unit.java**  \n   - Co-change confidence: ~0.3077  \n   - Conceptual coupling: 0.825  \n\n4. **Market.java**, **FreeColGameObject.java**, **GoodsContainer.java**  \n   - Moderate co-change confidence (~0.23)  \n\nEntities like **FreeCol** and **Messages** show up in the call graph and should also be considered for synchronization due to direct usage.\n\nThese findings provide a comprehensive view of potential ripple effects stemming from changes to `Goods.java`.",

Likely to be impacted by changes in logic involving location or settlement handling.  \n- **Building.java**: Strong historical co-change (~0.3846) and high conceptual coupling (0.819). Likely shares similar domain logic related to production or storage.  \n- **Unit.java**: Moderate co-change (~0.3077) and very high conceptual coupling (0.825).

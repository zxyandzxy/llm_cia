In order to help solve the CIA mission, you should first understand some necessary concepts\uff1a\n(1)entity: Entities represent source code files in CIA tasks, and all the CIA tasks under study are based on the Java language, so entities are files with the .java extension.\n(2)starting entity: The starting entity is also called salient entity, and the salient entity is the root change that causes the modification of the rest of entities in a change set, while the rest of entities are the dependency modification along with the salient one.\nYou will be presented with a starting entity and tools (functions) will be provided to access the more information of the origin system. Your task is to gradually explain which entity really need to be synchronized, based on the starting entity and the information obtained through the function-call. You have 7 chances to call the function to get more information."

This indicates that **Goods.java** directly interacts with `Unit` objects, especially during operations like loading goods onto units.\n\n---\n\n### Updated CIA Summary:\n\n| Entity        | Co-Change Support | Confidence | Structural Dependency | Conceptual Coupling |\n|---------------|-------------------|------------|-----------------------|---------------------|\n| Colony.java   | 6                 | 0.4615     | \u2705 Yes (Instanceof)    | \u2014                   |\n| Building.java | 5                 | 0.3846     | \u274c No                  | \u2705 0.819             |\n| Unit.java     | 4                 | 0.3077     | \u2705 Yes (TC, IO, FPIM) | \u2014                   |\n\n---\n\n### Final Step: Decide on Synchronization\n\nBased on the results so far, the following entities should be considered for synchronization when **Goods.java** changes:\n\n### \u2705 Entities to Synchronize:\n1. **Colony.java** \u2013 Direct use via `instanceof`\n2. **Unit.java** \u2013 Direct casting and method calls\n3. **Building.java** \u2013 High conceptual coupling despite no direct reference\n\nWould you like me to examine any of these files' source code using `get_origin_code` to better understand the context of these dependencies?",

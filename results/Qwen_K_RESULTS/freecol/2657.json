The confidence indicates how often these entities were changed together with `UnitType.java` in the past.\n\n### Observations:\n1. **High Confidence Relationships**:\n   - Entities like `BuildingType.java` (confidence: ~0.2857), `TileImprovementType.java`, `ResourceType.java`, and `EquipmentType.java` (all ~0.238) have relatively high confidence scores. These indicate strong historical co-change relationships.\n   \n2. **Moderate Confidence Relationships**:\n   - Entities like `Unit.java`, `Colony.java`, `FreeColGameObjectType.java`, and `EuropeanNationType.java` also show moderate confidence (~0.19), indicating they are frequently associated with changes to `UnitType.java`.\n\n3. **Low Confidence Relationships**:\n   - Many other entities, such as `DragListener.java`, `FoundingFather.java`, and `AIPlayer.java`, have lower confidence scores (~0.047-0.095). While they do appear alongside `UnitType.java` in some changes, the association is much weaker.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendation:\n\nTo identify which entities truly need synchronization with `UnitType.java`, we can focus on those with higher confidence scores, as they historically tend to change together more often.\n\n#### Priority Candidates for Synchronization:\n1. **BuildingType.java** (confidence: 0.2857)\n2. **TileImprovementType.java** (confidence: 0.2381)\n3. **ResourceType.java** (confidence: 0.2381)\n4. **EquipmentType.java** (confidence: 0.1905)\n5. **Unit.java** (confidence: 0.1905)\n6. **Colony.java** (confidence: 0.1905)\n\nThese files should be prioritized for review or synchronization when changes are made to `UnitType.java`. \n\nWould you like to explore coupling dependencies or call graphs for any of these files to understand the technical relationships further?",

The confidence indicates how often these entities were changed together with `UnitType.java` in the past.\n\n### Observations:\n1. **High Confidence Relationships**:\n   - Entities like `BuildingType.java` (confidence: ~0.2857), `TileImprovementType.java`, `ResourceType.java`, and `EquipmentType.java` (all ~0.238) have relatively high confidence scores. These indicate strong historical co-change relationships.\n   \n2. **Moderate Confidence Relationships**:\n   - Entities like `Unit.java`, `Colony.java`, `FreeColGameObjectType.java`, and `EuropeanNationType.java` also show moderate confidence (~0.19), indicating they are frequently associated with changes to `UnitType.java`.\n\n3. **Low Confidence Relationships**:\n   - Many other entities, such as `DragListener.java`, `FoundingFather.java`, and `AIPlayer.java`, have lower confidence scores (~0.047-0.095). While they do appear alongside `UnitType.java` in some changes, the association is much weaker.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendation:\n\nTo identify which entities truly need synchronization with `UnitType.java`, we can focus on those with higher confidence scores, as they historically tend to change together more often.\n\n#### Priority Candidates for Synchronization:\n1. **BuildingType.java** (confidence: 0.2857)\n2. **TileImprovementType.java** (confidence: 0.2381)\n3. **ResourceType.java** (confidence: 0.2381)\n4. **EquipmentType.java** (confidence: 0.1905)\n5. **Unit.java** (confidence: 0.1905)\n6. **Colony.java** (confidence: 0.1905)\n\nThese files should be prioritized for review or synchronization when changes are made to `UnitType.java`. \n\nWould you like to explore coupling dependencies or call graphs for any of these files to understand the technical relationships further?",

The rest of the entities from the co-change list are included due to their historical correlation, though weaker than `GoodsLabel`. To ensure recall, additional entities were inferred based on their conceptual and structural relevance in the context of FreeCol\u2019s domain model (e.g., core types like `GoodsType`, `Colony`, `BuildingType`, etc.), which are semantically and functionally related to production and goods handling within the system. These entities collectively form a comprehensive change set that should be considered when modifying `ProductionLabel.java`.",

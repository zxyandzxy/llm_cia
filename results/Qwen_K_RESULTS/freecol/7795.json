The confidence score helps us identify how often these entities were changed in tandem.\n\n### Key Observations:\n- **High Confidence Relationships**:\n  - `InGameController` has a high confidence of 0.8235 (modified together 14 times out of 17 total changes to ServerPlayer).\n  - `ServerUnit` has a confidence of 0.2941 (modified together 5 times).\n  - `ServerColony` has a confidence of 0.1765 (modified together 3 times).\n  - `StanceChange` also shows a confidence of 0.2941 (modified together 5 times).\n\nThese entities (`InGameController`, `ServerUnit`, `ServerColony`, and `StanceChange`) are strong candidates for further analysis since they are closely related to `ServerPlayer.java` based on historical change patterns.\n\n### Next Steps:\nTo better understand why these entities are co-changed with `ServerPlayer.java`, I will:\n1. Analyze the coupling dependencies between `ServerPlayer.java` and `InGameController.java` (highest confidence co-change).\n2.

Analyze the coupling dependencies between `ServerPlayer.java` and `InGameController.java` (highest confidence co-change).\n2.

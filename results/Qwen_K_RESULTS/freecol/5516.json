Entities with **high confidence (> 10%)**, as they are frequently modified together historically.\n2. Entities that are **semantically or structurally coupled** to `Building.java`.\n\nWe already have the co-change data.

Entities with **high confidence (> 10%)**, as they are frequently modified together historically.\n2. Entities that are **semantically or structurally coupled** to `Building.java`.\n\nWe already have the co-change data.

We can use the `get_conceptual_coupling` function for this purpose.\n\nShall we analyze semantic coupling for `Building.java` and one of these files?

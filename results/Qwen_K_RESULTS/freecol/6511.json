Your task is to gradually explain which entity really need to be synchronized, based on the starting entity and the information obtained through the function-call.

This indicates that `Settlement.java` plays a role within the broader `FreeCol` application context, potentially affecting or being affected by global application logic.\n\n### Interpretation:\n- While `FreeCol` may not require direct synchronization with `Settlement.java`, this relationship suggests that changes in `Settlement.java` could have **system-wide implications**, especially if `Settlement` is central to core functionality.\n- This reinforces the importance of monitoring and testing interactions at a higher level when modifying `Settlement.java`.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Final Recommendation:\n\nBased on co-change relationships and coupling dependencies, the following entities **should be synchronized** when modifying **Settlement.java**:\n\n1. **IndianSettlement.java** \u2013 Strong inheritance and instanceof dependency.\n2. **Colony.java** \u2013 Strong inheritance and instanceof dependency.\n\nEntities like **InGameController.java**, **IndianNationType.java**, and others with only historical co-changes but no direct coupling should be **monitored**, but **not necessarily synchronized** unless further evidence (e.g., runtime errors, feature interdependence) suggests otherwise.\n\nLet me know if you'd like to explore conceptual coupling or code similarity between Settlement and any other files!",

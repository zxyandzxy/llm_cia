This suggests that while these files were changed together once, there isn't strong historical evidence to indicate a consistent pattern of change.\n- These files may need further investigation to determine if they are likely to be impacted by changes in `Server.java`.\n\n### Next Steps:\nTo better understand how these files might be related to `Server.java`, I will investigate their coupling dependencies. Let me start by analyzing the coupling between `Server.java` and one of the co-changed files: `FreeColServer`.\n\n",

Changes in `Region.java` could directly affect the behavior or structure of `ServerRegion.java`.\n\nIf you would like to proceed further\u2014for example, by analyzing semantic similarity or call graphs\u2014please let me know.

Changes in `Region.java` could directly affect the behavior or structure of `ServerRegion.java`.\n\nIf you would like to proceed further\u2014for example, by analyzing semantic similarity or call graphs\u2014please let me know.

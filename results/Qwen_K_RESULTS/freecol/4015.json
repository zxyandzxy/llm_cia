While they were modified alongside `UnitType.java`, their connection seems weaker.\n\n### Recommendation:\nStart with synchronizing changes in **BuildingType.java**, **TileImprovementType.java**, and **ResourceType.java** due to their high confidence scores. Further analysis of dependencies or conceptual coupling with these files will help refine the CIA results.\n\nWould you like to explore coupling dependencies or call graphs next?",

                "content": "The co-change relationship analysis reveals several entities that are frequently modified alongside `UnitType.java`. Here are the key observations:\n\n1. **High Confidence Co-Changes:**\n   - **BuildingType.java (6 modifications, 0.2857 confidence)**: Strong correlation with `UnitType.java`, suggesting it is likely to be impacted by changes.\n   - **TileImprovementType.java (5 modifications, 0.2381 confidence)**: Another high-confidence candidate for synchronization.\n   - **ResourceType.java (5 modifications, 0.2381 confidence)**: Frequently changed along with `UnitType.java`.\n   - **TileType.java (5 modifications, 0.2381 confidence)**: Also shows significant coupling.\n\n2. **Moderate Confidence Co-Changes:**\n   - Entities like **Colony.java**, **Unit.java**, **EuropeanNationType.java**, and others show moderate confidence scores ranging between 0.14 to 0.19.\n   - These entities may require further investigation based on specific change scenarios.\n\n3. **Low Confidence Co-Changes:**\n   - Many files like `FoundingFather.java`, `GoodsType.java`, and others have low confidence values (~0.0476). While they were modified alongside `UnitType.java`, their connection seems weaker.\n\n### Recommendation:\nStart with synchronizing changes in **BuildingType.java**, **TileImprovementType.java**, and **ResourceType.java** due to their high confidence scores. Further analysis of dependencies or conceptual coupling with these files will help refine the CIA results.\n\nWould you like to explore coupling dependencies or call graphs next?",

They should be prioritized for synchronization checks.\n\n2. **Low Support and Confidence Relationships (0.25 confidence level)**:\n   - There are multiple entities with only 1 support count and 0.25 confidence, such as `\"StealLandMessage\"`, `\"FreeColServer\"`, `\"BuyLandMessage\"`, etc.\n\n   While they show some relationship, their low confidence suggests a weaker connection. However, since they still appear in co-changes, it may be worth investigating if there is any conceptual or coupling dependency between them and `Message.java`.\n\n### Next Steps\n- To validate the high-confidence relationships, we can analyze the coupling dependencies between `Message.java` and both `\"InGameInputHandler\"` and `\"InGameController\"`.\n- For a deeper understanding of the low-confidence relationships, we could examine the conceptual coupling or look into the call graph of `Message.java` to see if any of these entities are directly referenced.\n\nWould you like to explore the coupling dependencies for `Message.java` with `\"InGameInputHandler\"` and `\"InGameController\"`?",

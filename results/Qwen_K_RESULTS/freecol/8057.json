This is the highest confidence value observed in the set.\n   \n2. **Lower Confidence Co-Changes:**\n   - The remaining files such as `\"FreeColGameObjectType\"`, `\"BuildingType\"`, `\"EuropeanNationType\"`, `\"IndianNationType\"`, `\"Specification\"`, `\"Feature\"`, `\"Modifier\"`, `\"Colony\"`, `\"InGameController\"`, `\"ColonyTest\"`, `\"FreeColClient\"`, `\"ImageResource\"`, and `\"AudioResource\"` all have a confidence value of `0.25`. These indicate weaker historical correlation in changes.\n\n### Recommendation:\nBased on the co-change analysis:\n- It is strongly recommended to review and potentially synchronize changes with `\"UnitType.java\"` due to its relatively high confidence score (`0.5`).\n- For the rest of the entities (confidence = 0.25), they might not require synchronization unless there is additional contextual or functional dependency identified.\n\nNext, we can analyze functional dependencies by checking call graphs for `FeatureContainer.java` to identify which entities it directly interacts with during execution.

This is the highest confidence value observed in the set.\n   \n2. **Lower Confidence Co-Changes:**\n   - The remaining files such as `\"FreeColGameObjectType\"`, `\"BuildingType\"`, `\"EuropeanNationType\"`, `\"IndianNationType\"`, `\"Specification\"`, `\"Feature\"`, `\"Modifier\"`, `\"Colony\"`, `\"InGameController\"`, `\"ColonyTest\"`, `\"FreeColClient\"`, `\"ImageResource\"`, and `\"AudioResource\"` all have a confidence value of `0.25`. These indicate weaker historical correlation in changes.\n\n### Recommendation:\nBased on the co-change analysis:\n- It is strongly recommended to review and potentially synchronize changes with `\"UnitType.java\"` due to its relatively high confidence score (`0.5`).\n- For the rest of the entities (confidence = 0.25), they might not require synchronization unless there is additional contextual or functional dependency identified.\n\nNext, we can analyze functional dependencies by checking call graphs for `FeatureContainer.java` to identify which entities it directly interacts with during execution.

These entities were changed together in all historical instances.\n  \n- **Moderate to Lower Co-Change Frequency:**\n  - Several other files, such as `PluginSet`, `CharIndexedSegment`, and others, also show some level of co-change relationship, but their confidence values are significantly lower (e.g., ~0.36 or lower).\n  - Many files exhibit a confidence of only `0.18`, indicating they were rarely changed together with `ParserRule.java`.\n\n### Recommendation:\nBased on this data, we should prioritize checking if changes in `ParserRule.java` impact the following two files due to their high confidence scores:\n1. **TokenMarker**\n2. **XModeHandler**\n\nTo further analyze whether these files need synchronization, we can use additional tools like examining coupling dependencies or conceptual similarity.

These entities were changed together in all historical instances.\n  \n- **Moderate to Lower Co-Change Frequency:**\n  - Several other files, such as `PluginSet`, `CharIndexedSegment`, and others, also show some level of co-change relationship, but their confidence values are significantly lower (e.g., ~0.36 or lower).\n  - Many files exhibit a confidence of only `0.18`, indicating they were rarely changed together with `ParserRule.java`.\n\n### Recommendation:\nBased on this data, we should prioritize checking if changes in `ParserRule.java` impact the following two files due to their high confidence scores:\n1. **TokenMarker**\n2. **XModeHandler**\n\nTo further analyze whether these files need synchronization, we can use additional tools like examining coupling dependencies or conceptual similarity. Let's proceed by analyzing the **coupling dependencies** between `ParserRule.java` and these top co-changed entities.\n\nFirst, I will examine coupling dependencies between `ParserRule.java` and `TokenMarker`.\n\n",

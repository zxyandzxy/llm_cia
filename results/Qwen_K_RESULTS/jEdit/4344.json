Although no direct coupling dependencies exist between `HelpSearchPanel.java` and other components, the co-change analysis revealed that `HelpTOCPanel` and `HelpViewer` are consistently modified together with 100% confidence. Additionally, conceptual coupling scores (over 0.88) indicate significant semantic similarity, suggesting shared responsibilities or functional overlaps.\n\nTo ensure recall and capture all potentially affected entities, we extended the list to include other help-related components that are likely involved in similar feature sets or UI interactions, even if their co-change data wasn't explicitly analyzed here.

Although no direct coupling dependencies exist between `HelpSearchPanel.java` and other components, the co-change analysis revealed that `HelpTOCPanel` and `HelpViewer` are consistently modified together with 100% confidence. Additionally, conceptual coupling scores (over 0.88) indicate significant semantic similarity, suggesting shared responsibilities or functional overlaps.\n\nTo ensure recall and capture all potentially affected entities, we extended the list to include other help-related components that are likely involved in similar feature sets or UI interactions, even if their co-change data wasn't explicitly analyzed here.

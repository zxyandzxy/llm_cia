This explains why they have been co-changed in the past \u2014 changes to input handling logic in `AbstractInputHandler` likely affect the behavior or configuration of `GrabKeyDialog`, which may rely on similar concepts or configurations related to key binding or user interaction.\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n\n- **TextAreaInputHandler.java**:\n  - Direct inheritance relationship (IH).\n  - High priority for synchronization due to being a subclass.\n  \n- **GrabKeyDialog.java**:\n  - No structural coupling found.\n  - Strong conceptual coupling (semantic similarity ~85%).\n  - Synchronization is justified due to shared functionality and historical co-change.\n\n### Next Steps:\nTo ensure completeness, we could also examine what other entities `AbstractInputHandler.java` directly interacts with by calling `get_call_graph`. This would help identify any additional dependencies not captured through co-change or conceptual coupling.\n\nWould you like me to proceed with this step?",

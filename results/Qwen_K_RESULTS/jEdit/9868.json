The rest of the entities such as PluginManager, KeyHandler, Occur, HyperSearchRequest, PositionManager, ActionHandler, and Debug have a confidence of ~0.67, meaning they are frequently co-modified but not always.\n3. **HyperSearchNode.java** and **HyperSearchFileNode.java** have lower confidence (0.33) with only one support each.\n\nGiven this data, we can infer that:\n- **HyperSearchResults.java** must be synchronized with HyperSearchResult.java due to its high confidence score.\n- Entities like PluginManager, KeyHandler, Occur, etc., should also be considered for synchronization due to their relatively high confidence scores.\n- Entities with low confidence (e.g., HyperSearchNode.java and HyperSearchFileNode.java) may or may not need synchronization; further investigation into their relationship with HyperSearchResult.java is required.\n\nTo proceed, I will analyze the coupling dependencies between **HyperSearchResult.java** and **HyperSearchResults.java**, since the latter has the highest confidence score.

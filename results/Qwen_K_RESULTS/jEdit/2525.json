They are highly likely to be impacted by any changes to `ParserRule.java`.\n\n2. **Lower Confidence Relationships:**\n   Entities such as `PluginSet`, `CharIndexedSegment`, and others show much lower confidence values (ranging from ~0.09 to ~0.36). These entities may not always need synchronization but could still merit attention depending on the nature of the change.\n\n### Recommended Next Steps:\nTo further refine our understanding of the relationships between `ParserRule.java` and the other entities, especially those with high confidence scores, I will perform additional analysis using the `get_call_graph` function for `ParserRule.java`. This will help us identify direct dependencies based on method calls or variable references.\n\n",

The confidence level of these co-change relationships varies, and we can use this information to determine which entities should be synchronized.\n\n### Observations:\n1. **High Confidence Relationships (Confidence = 1.0):**\n   - `TokenMarker`\n   - `XModeHandler`\n   These two entities were modified together with `ParserRule.java` in all instances where `ParserRule.java` was changed. They are highly likely to be impacted by any changes to `ParserRule.java`.\n\n2. **Lower Confidence Relationships:**\n   Entities such as `PluginSet`, `CharIndexedSegment`, and others show much lower confidence values (ranging from ~0.09 to ~0.36). These entities may not always need synchronization but could still merit attention depending on the nature of the change.\n\n### Recommended Next Steps:\nTo further refine our understanding of the relationships between `ParserRule.java` and the other entities, especially those with high confidence scores, I will perform additional analysis using the `get_call_graph` function for `ParserRule.java`. This will help us identify direct dependencies based on method calls or variable references.\n\n",

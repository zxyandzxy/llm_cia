Therefore, to maintain consistency and avoid potential issues, it would be prudent to **synchronize changes** to `OperatingSystem.java` with both:\n\n1. `EnhancedMenuItem.java`\n2. `EnhancedCheckBoxMenuItem.java`\n\nIf needed, we can examine the actual source code of these files to uncover more specific contextual relationships.

Therefore, to maintain consistency and avoid potential issues, it would be prudent to **synchronize changes** to `OperatingSystem.java` with both:\n\n1. `EnhancedMenuItem.java`\n2. `EnhancedCheckBoxMenuItem.java`\n\nIf needed, we can examine the actual source code of these files to uncover more specific contextual relationships.

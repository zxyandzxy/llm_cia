They likely need to be synchronized.\n\n2. **Medium Confidence Relationships (0.3 \u2264 Confidence \u2264 0.5):**\n   - `VFSDirectoryEntryTableModel.java` (Support: 2, Confidence: ~28.57%)\n   - `InstallPanel.java` (Support: 2, Confidence: ~28.57%)\n   - `TableMouseHandler.java` (Support: 2, Confidence: ~28.57%)\n   - `ParentMouseHandler.java` (Support: 2, Confidence: ~28.57%)\n   - `PositionManager.java` (Support: 2, Confidence: ~28.57%)\n   - `KeyEventWorkaround.java` (Support: 2, Confidence: ~28.57%)\n   - `ParentDirectoryList.java` (Support: 2, Confidence: ~28.57%)\n   These files show moderate historical co-change frequency and may need further investigation for synchronization depending on context.\n\n3. **Low Confidence Relationships (Confidence < 0.2):**\n   - `VFSPathSelected.java` (Support: 1, Confidence: ~14.29%)\n   - `MainMouseHandler.java` (Support: 1, Confidence: ~14.29%)\n   These entities exhibit low confidence and minimal historical ties, suggesting they may not require synchronization unless additional dependencies are confirmed.\n\nTo proceed with determining which entities truly need synchronization, it is advisable to examine coupling dependencies or conceptual similarities between `VFSDirectoryEntryTable.java` and the top candidates (`BrowserView.java`, `FileCellRenderer.java`) as well as any others under consideration.

The co-change relationships, along with their support counts and confidence values, suggest how often these files were changed in conjunction with the starting entity historically.\n\nHere\u2019s an interpretation of the results:\n\n1. **High Confidence Relationships (Confidence > 0.5):**\n   - `BrowserView.java` (Support: 4, Confidence: ~57.14%)\n   - `FileCellRenderer.java` (Support: 4, Confidence: ~57.14%)\n   These entities have been modified alongside `VFSDirectoryEntryTable.java` most frequently and with higher confidence, indicating a strong relationship. They likely need to be synchronized.\n\n2. **Medium Confidence Relationships (0.3 \u2264 Confidence \u2264 0.5):**\n   - `VFSDirectoryEntryTableModel.java` (Support: 2, Confidence: ~28.57%)\n   - `InstallPanel.java` (Support: 2, Confidence: ~28.57%)\n   - `TableMouseHandler.java` (Support: 2, Confidence: ~28.57%)\n   - `ParentMouseHandler.java` (Support: 2, Confidence: ~28.57%)\n   - `PositionManager.java` (Support: 2, Confidence: ~28.57%)\n   - `KeyEventWorkaround.java` (Support: 2, Confidence: ~28.57%)\n   - `ParentDirectoryList.java` (Support: 2, Confidence: ~28.57%)\n   These files show moderate historical co-change frequency and may need further investigation for synchronization depending on context.\n\n3. **Low Confidence Relationships (Confidence < 0.2):**\n   - `VFSPathSelected.java` (Support: 1, Confidence: ~14.29%)\n   - `MainMouseHandler.java` (Support: 1, Confidence: ~14.29%)\n   These entities exhibit low confidence and minimal historical ties, suggesting they may not require synchronization unless additional dependencies are confirmed.\n\nTo proceed with determining which entities truly need synchronization, it is advisable to examine coupling dependencies or conceptual similarities between `VFSDirectoryEntryTable.java` and the top candidates (`BrowserView.java`, `FileCellRenderer.java`) as well as any others under consideration.

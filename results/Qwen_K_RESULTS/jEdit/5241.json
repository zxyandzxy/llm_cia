Additionally, we may explore coupling dependencies or conceptual coupling between these files and `HyperSearchOperationNode.java` to validate their relationship.\n\n#### Next Step:\nCall `get_coupling_dependencies` between `HyperSearchOperationNode.java` and `MouseHandler.java` to identify any direct coupling.\n\n",

In order to help solve the CIA mission, you should first understand some necessary concepts\uff1a\n(1)entity: Entities represent source code files in CIA tasks, and all the CIA tasks under study are based on the Java language, so entities are files with the .java extension.\n(2)starting entity: The starting entity is also called salient entity, and the salient entity is the root change that causes the modification of the rest of entities in a change set, while the rest of entities are the dependency modification along with the salient one.\nYou will be presented with a starting entity and tools (functions) will be provided to access the more information of the origin system. Your task is to gradually explain which entity really need to be synchronized, based on the starting entity and the information obtained through the function-call. You have 7 chances to call the function to get more information."

As such, `EditPane` may not require synchronization solely based on changes to `TextArea.java`.\n\n### Summary of Findings\nSo far, our analysis has revealed that the following entities have significant dependencies with `TextArea.java`:\n1. **JEditTextArea** - Strong inheritance-based dependency.\n2. **TextAreaPainter** - Tight coupling through member variable usage and method invocations.\n3. **Gutter** - Strong coupling via member variable usage and method calls.\n\nEntities like `EditPane` with no direct coupling dependencies should be deprioritized for synchronization unless further contextual or conceptual coupling is identified.\n\n### Next Steps\nTo ensure thoroughness, we can now analyze the **conceptual coupling** (semantic similarity) between `TextArea.java` and these dependent entities (`JEditTextArea`, `TextAreaPainter`, and `Gutter`). This will provide additional insights into their functional relationships from a natural language processing perspective.\n\nLet\u2019s start by analyzing the conceptual coupling between `TextArea.java` and `JEditTextArea`.\n",

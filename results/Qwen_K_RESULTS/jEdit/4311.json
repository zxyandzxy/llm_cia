This indicates a strong dependency or functional coupling.\n- **XModeHandler** also shows a relatively high confidence (0.625), suggesting a meaningful connection with `ParserRuleSet.java`.\n- Other entities such as **ParserRule**, **LineContext**, etc., show moderate to low confidence, indicating weaker or situational dependencies.\n\n### Next Steps:\nTo further determine which entities need synchronization, we can analyze the coupling dependencies between `ParserRuleSet.java` and the top candidates for synchronization (`TokenMarker.java` and `XModeHandler.java`).

This means that these two entities are not directly linked through code constructs such as method calls, inheritance, or variable references.\n\nHowever, since `BeanShellAction.java` has a high co-change confidence with `BeanShell.java`, the changes might be due to logical or functional dependencies rather than structural ones. To further investigate this, we should look at the conceptual coupling (semantic similarity) between `BeanShell.java` and `BeanShellAction.java`.\n\nLet's analyze their conceptual coupling next using the `get_conceptual_coupling` function.\n",

As a result, it is highly recommended to synchronize `BeanShellAction.java` when `BeanShell.java` is modified.\n\nAre there any other entities from the co-change list you'd like to investigate further?

The entities with higher confidence scores indicate stronger co-change relationships, meaning they are more likely to be impacted by or related to changes in the `DisplayManager.java`.\n\nHere is an analysis of some top results:\n\n1. **BufferChangeHandler (Support: 9, Confidence: 0.5625)**  \n   This entity has the highest support and confidence score. It indicates a strong relationship with `DisplayManager.java`. Changes in `DisplayManager.java` often coincide with modifications in `BufferChangeHandler.java`. Therefore, this file should be carefully reviewed for synchronization.\n\n2. **FirstLine, ScrollLineCount, ChunkCache (Support: 6, Confidence: 0.375)**  \n   These files have moderate confidence scores and support counts. They represent potential dependencies or interactions with `DisplayManager.java`, possibly involved in managing display logic or rendering components. These should also be considered for further investigation.\n\n3. **HelpIndex, HelpTOCPanel, View, RingListModel, OffsetManager, PosBottomHalf, PositionManager, PasteFromListDialog, ListHandler, KeyHandler, FontSelector, FontSelectorDialog, TextAreaOptionPane, ActionHandler, JEditTextArea, TextAreaPainter, EditPane, BeanShell (Confidence: 0.125 or higher)**  \n   While these files have lower confidence scores, they still appear alongside `DisplayManager.java` in version history. This suggests some level of connection, potentially through shared functionalities or UI components. These files may require review depending on the nature of the change in `DisplayManager.java`.\n\n4. **MouseHandler, Anchor, RangeMap (Confidence: 0.0625)**  \n   These files have very low confidence scores, indicating weak co-change relationships. However, they could still be relevant if the changes in `DisplayManager.java` directly touch related functionality (e.g., mouse interaction or anchoring ranges).\n\n### Recommended Synchronized Entities:\nBased on the co-change analysis, here are the most critical entities that should be synchronized or checked for ripple effects:\n\n- **BufferChangeHandler.java** (Top priority)\n- **FirstLine.java**\n- **ScrollLineCount.java**\n- **ChunkCache.java**\n\nIf you'd like to dig deeper into the relationships between `DisplayManager.java` and any of these files, I can use additional tools (like `get_coupling_dependencies`, `get_conceptual_coupling`, or `get_call_graph`) to analyze their dependencies or semantic similarities. \n\nWould you like to proceed with analyzing dependencies for one of these files? For example, we could check the coupling dependencies between `DisplayManager.java` and `BufferChangeHandler.java`.",

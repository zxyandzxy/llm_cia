There is a relatively low confidence in this co-change relationship.\n\n2. **DefaultInputHandler.java**:\n   - Support Count: 4\n   - Confidence: ~66.67%\n   - This indicates a stronger relationship compared to others, as `DefaultInputHandler.java` appears alongside changes to `KeyEventWorkaround.java` more frequently.\n\n3. **IndentFoldHandler.java**:\n   - Support Count: 2\n   - Confidence: ~33.33%\n   - Similar to `MouseHandler.java`, this file shows a moderate but less significant correlation with `KeyEventWorkaround.java`.\n\n4. **KeyEventTranslator.java**:\n   - Support Count: 2\n   - Confidence: ~33.33%\n   - Another file with a similar level of correlation, potentially related to handling key events.\n\n5. **Debug.java**:\n   - Support Count: 2\n   - Confidence: ~33.33%\n   - This might be due to debugging-related changes often being made in tandem with modifications to `KeyEventWorkaround.java`.\n\n### Conclusion:\nAmong these files, `DefaultInputHandler.java` has the highest confidence (~66.67%) and support count (4), indicating that it likely needs synchronization most often when `KeyEventWorkaround.java` is modified.

Here is the interpretation of the results:\n\n1. **MouseHandler.java**:\n   - Support Count: 2\n   - Confidence: ~33.33%\n   - This means that in the project's version history, whenever `KeyEventWorkaround.java` was modified, `MouseHandler.java` was also modified in 2 out of all modification instances of `KeyEventWorkaround.java`. There is a relatively low confidence in this co-change relationship.\n\n2. **DefaultInputHandler.java**:\n   - Support Count: 4\n   - Confidence: ~66.67%\n   - This indicates a stronger relationship compared to others, as `DefaultInputHandler.java` appears alongside changes to `KeyEventWorkaround.java` more frequently.\n\n3. **IndentFoldHandler.java**:\n   - Support Count: 2\n   - Confidence: ~33.33%\n   - Similar to `MouseHandler.java`, this file shows a moderate but less significant correlation with `KeyEventWorkaround.java`.\n\n4. **KeyEventTranslator.java**:\n   - Support Count: 2\n   - Confidence: ~33.33%\n   - Another file with a similar level of correlation, potentially related to handling key events.\n\n5. **Debug.java**:\n   - Support Count: 2\n   - Confidence: ~33.33%\n   - This might be due to debugging-related changes often being made in tandem with modifications to `KeyEventWorkaround.java`.\n\n### Conclusion:\nAmong these files, `DefaultInputHandler.java` has the highest confidence (~66.67%) and support count (4), indicating that it likely needs synchronization most often when `KeyEventWorkaround.java` is modified. The rest of the files also show some degree of co-change relationships, albeit with lower confidence.\n\nTo proceed further, we can analyze the coupling dependencies between `KeyEventWorkaround.java` and these co-changed entities, particularly focusing on `DefaultInputHandler.java` given its high confidence score. Let's investigate the dependencies next by calling the `get_coupling_dependencies` function for `KeyEventWorkaround.java` and `DefaultInputHandler.java`.\n",

It is likely tightly coupled or functionally related to `DockableWindowManager`.\n\n2. **FloatingWindowContainer (support: 9, confidence: 0.36)**  \n   - High support and confidence, indicating a significant dependency.\n\n3. **ButtonLayout (support: 8, confidence: 0.32)**\n   - Frequent co-change behavior suggests possible UI-related coordination.\n\n4. **Entry (support: 6, confidence: 0.24)**\n   - Moderate support and confidence, possibly involved in data structures or models used by the window manager.\n\n5. **MouseHandler (support: 6, confidence: 0.24)**\n   - Likely involved in event handling that interacts with dockable windows.\n\n6. **DockingOptionPane (support: 3, confidence: 0.12)**\n   - May be involved in configuration or options related to docking functionality.\n\n7. **ActionHandler (support: 3, confidence: 0.12)**\n   - Could relate to action execution within dockable windows.\n\n8. **DockableWindowCompare (support: 2, confidence: 0.08)**\n   - Might assist in comparing or organizing dockable windows.\n\nOther entities such as `GlobalOptions`, `AppearanceOptionPane`, `PluginOptions`, etc., also show some correlation but with lower support and confidence. They may still be relevant depending on the nature of the change, especially if it involves global settings or appearance-related logic.\n\nTo refine this list further and identify precise dependencies, I will analyze coupling relationships or call graph information starting with the strongest co-changed entity: **PanelWindowContainer**.\n\nI will now check the coupling between `DockableWindowManager.java` and `PanelWindowContainer.java`. \n\n",

It is likely tightly coupled or functionally related to `DockableWindowManager`.\n\n2. **FloatingWindowContainer (support: 9, confidence: 0.36)**  \n   - High support and confidence, indicating a significant dependency.\n\n3. **ButtonLayout (support: 8, confidence: 0.32)**\n   - Frequent co-change behavior suggests possible UI-related coordination.\n\n4. **Entry (support: 6, confidence: 0.24)**\n   - Moderate support and confidence, possibly involved in data structures or models used by the window manager.\n\n5. **MouseHandler (support: 6, confidence: 0.24)**\n   - Likely involved in event handling that interacts with dockable windows.\n\n6. **DockingOptionPane (support: 3, confidence: 0.12)**\n   - May be involved in configuration or options related to docking functionality.\n\n7. **ActionHandler (support: 3, confidence: 0.12)**\n   - Could relate to action execution within dockable windows.\n\n8. **DockableWindowCompare (support: 2, confidence: 0.08)**\n   - Might assist in comparing or organizing dockable windows.\n\nOther entities such as `GlobalOptions`, `AppearanceOptionPane`, `PluginOptions`, etc., also show some correlation but with lower support and confidence. They may still be relevant depending on the nature of the change, especially if it involves global settings or appearance-related logic.\n\nTo refine this list further and identify precise dependencies, I will analyze coupling relationships or call graph information starting with the strongest co-changed entity: **PanelWindowContainer**.\n\nI will now check the coupling between `DockableWindowManager.java` and `PanelWindowContainer.java`. \n\n",

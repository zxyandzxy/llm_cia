This indicates a direct functional dependency, making synchronization highly likely.  \n- **Macro**: Although this file has been removed from the project, it was historically closely related to `Macros.java`. Based on co-change data, it was modified together with `Macros.java` twice with 100% confidence, indicating strong historical correlation.  \n- **DefaultInputHandler**: No direct coupling was found; however, it co-changed with `Macros.java` twice with 100% confidence. This suggests potential indirect or contextual dependencies that may require review.  \n- **KeyEventWorkaround**: No direct coupling was found, but it co-changed with `Macros.java` twice with 100% confidence, indicating possible contextual or historical linkage.  \n- **ActionHandler**: Removed from the project, but previously had strong co-change history with `Macros.java` (2 co-changes, 100% confidence).

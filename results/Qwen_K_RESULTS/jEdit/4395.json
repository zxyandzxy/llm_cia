The confidence value represents the probability that these entities were modified whenever `OptionsDialog.java` was modified.\n\n### Observations:\n1. There are 10 entities that show co-change relationships with `OptionsDialog.java`.\n2. Entities like `TokenMarker.java` and `KeyHandler.java` have relatively higher confidence (33.3%) compared to others.\n3. Other entities, such as `BrowserCommandsMenu.java`, `GlobalOptions.java`, and `GutterOptionPane.java`, have a lower confidence (16.6%).\n\nNow, to better understand why these files are related to `OptionsDialog.java`, we can explore their coupling dependencies. This will help us determine if there are direct or indirect code-level dependencies between them.\n\nNext, I will analyze the coupling dependencies between `OptionsDialog.java` and the top two co-changed entities: `TokenMarker.java` and `KeyHandler.java`.\n\n",

This explains the **co-change relationship** without requiring **direct coupling**.\n- `PluginJAR` might be involved in registering or managing plugins that respond to menu changes, hence the co-change pattern.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis:\n- The **main entities that need synchronization** with changes to `DynamicMenuChanged.java` are:\n  - **PluginJAR.java**\n  - **EnhancedMenu.java**\n\nThese co-changes are likely necessary because:\n- `EnhancedMenu` may react to the `DynamicMenuChanged` event.\n- `PluginJAR` could manage plugin-related menu entries that are affected by dynamic menu changes.\n\nNo further tool calls are needed.

This explains the **co-change relationship** without requiring **direct coupling**.\n- `PluginJAR` might be involved in registering or managing plugins that respond to menu changes, hence the co-change pattern.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis:\n- The **main entities that need synchronization** with changes to `DynamicMenuChanged.java` are:\n  - **PluginJAR.java**\n  - **EnhancedMenu.java**\n\nThese co-changes are likely necessary because:\n- `EnhancedMenu` may react to the `DynamicMenuChanged` event.\n- `PluginJAR` could manage plugin-related menu entries that are affected by dynamic menu changes.\n\nNo further tool calls are needed.

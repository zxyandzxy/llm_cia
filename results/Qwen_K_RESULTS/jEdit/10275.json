The coupling type found is **ConstructorInvoking (CMAIM)**, indicating that methods from `BrowserView` are being invoked within `VFSDirectoryEntryTable`.\n\n### Key Coupling Details:\n- Multiple methods in `VFSDirectoryEntryTable` (e.g., `toggleExpanded`, `setDirectory`, `maybeReloadDirectory`, `processKeyEvent`) utilize an instance of `BrowserView` to invoke corresponding methods such as `clearExpansionState`, `loadDirectory`, `saveExpansionState`, and `getBrowser`.\n- These interactions occur across various lines in the code, highlighting a strong functional dependency.\n\nThis level of coupling reinforces the importance of synchronizing changes between these two entities. Modifying `VFSDirectoryEntryTable.java` could easily impact the behavior of `BrowserView.java`, especially since they interact so frequently.\n\nGiven this information, we can now also check for **semantic similarity** between `VFSDirectoryEntryTable.java` and `BrowserView.java` using the `get_conceptual_coupling` function to further validate their relationship.\n",

The coupling type found is **ConstructorInvoking (CMAIM)**, indicating that methods from `BrowserView` are being invoked within `VFSDirectoryEntryTable`.\n\n### Key Coupling Details:\n- Multiple methods in `VFSDirectoryEntryTable` (e.g., `toggleExpanded`, `setDirectory`, `maybeReloadDirectory`, `processKeyEvent`) utilize an instance of `BrowserView` to invoke corresponding methods such as `clearExpansionState`, `loadDirectory`, `saveExpansionState`, and `getBrowser`.\n- These interactions occur across various lines in the code, highlighting a strong functional dependency.\n\nThis level of coupling reinforces the importance of synchronizing changes between these two entities. Modifying `VFSDirectoryEntryTable.java` could easily impact the behavior of `BrowserView.java`, especially since they interact so frequently.\n\nGiven this information, we can now also check for **semantic similarity** between `VFSDirectoryEntryTable.java` and `BrowserView.java` using the `get_conceptual_coupling` function to further validate their relationship.\n",

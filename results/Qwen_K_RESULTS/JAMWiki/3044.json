It implies frequent synchronized changes, so this entity should definitely be considered for synchronization.\n\n2. **ImageMetadata** (`support = 8`, `confidence = 0.444`)  \n   - A moderate-to-high confidence suggests that changes in `ImageUtil.java` often require adjustments in `ImageMetadata`.\n\n3. **LinkUtil** (`support = 4`, `confidence = 0.222`)  \n   - Moderate support but lower confidence; could still have some relevance depending on context.\n\n4. **ParserFunctionUtil** (`support = 4`, `confidence = 0.222`)  \n   - Similar to LinkUtil, this has moderate support but low confidence.\n\n5. **JAMWikiUnitTest** (`support = 3`, `confidence = 0.167`)  \n   - While the confidence is low, it may indicate testing-related updates accompanying changes to `ImageUtil.java`.\n\n6. **WikiPageInfo** (`support = 3`, `confidence = 0.167`)  \n   - Likely a weaker relationship, but worth considering if there's domain overlap.\n\n7. **ImageUtilTest** (`support = 5`, `confidence = 0.278`)  \n   - Being a test file specific to `ImageUtil`, it naturally needs synchronization when the main file changes.\n\nFrom the above, **ImageLinkTag**, **ImageMetadata**, and **ImageUtilTest** are the most significant candidates for synchronization with `ImageUtil.java` due to their high support and confidence scores. \n\nWould you like to explore dependencies or coupling relationships further (e.g., call graph, conceptual coupling, or code inspection) to refine this analysis?",

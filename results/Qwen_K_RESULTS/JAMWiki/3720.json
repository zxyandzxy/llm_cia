Could be related to output generation or formatting tied to parser functions.\n- **MagicWordUtil**: Lower confidence (0.2), but appears in co-change history. Might share contextual string or keyword processing logic.\n- **JFlexParserUtil**: Lower confidence (0.2), but appears in co-change history. Could relate to lexical analysis or parsing infrastructure.\n- **MoveServlet**: Lowest confidence (0.2), minimal support.

This indicates that although there are no direct structural dependencies between the two files, they share a significant amount of **semantic similarity** in their code\u2014likely handling similar functionalities related to image processing or linking.\n\nThis strong conceptual coupling explains the high co-change confidence score and suggests that changes in `ImageUtil.java` could indeed impact `ImageLinkTag.java`.\n\n---\n\n### Next Steps:\n\nTo further explore the ripple effect, we can:\n1. Investigate if `ImageUtil.java` directly calls or references any other entities using `get_call_graph`.\n2. Examine the actual source code of `ImageUtil.java` to understand its functionality and how it might influence other components.\n\nWould you like to:\n- Call `get_call_graph` for `ImageUtil.java`, or\n- Retrieve the source code of `ImageUtil.java`?\n\nLet me know your preference!",

Please note that in order to ensure recall, you need to give as many entities as possible (preferably more than 40) that need to be modified synchronously based on your analysis, where the result of the function get_co_change_relationship should be used as an important reference.

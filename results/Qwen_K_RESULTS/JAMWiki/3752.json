It is a strong candidate for synchronization.\n   \n2. **SpamFilter.java** (Support: 3, Confidence: 0.75): Modified frequently alongside `ResourceUtil.java`, indicating a notable dependency.\n\n3. **Environment.java** (Support: 2, Confidence: 0.5), **WikiUtil.java** (Support: 2, Confidence: 0.5), **TestFileUtil.java** (Support: 2, Confidence: 0.5), **ServletUtil.java** (Support: 2, Confidence: 0.5), **DatabaseConnection.java** (Support: 2, Confidence: 0.5): These files show moderate confidence levels, suggesting some level of dependency or recurring change pattern with `ResourceUtil.java`.\n\nTo proceed further, I will analyze the coupling dependencies between `ResourceUtil.java` and these top candidates to understand the structural relationships better.

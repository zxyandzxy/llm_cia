This suggests they may need synchronization more frequently when `LogItem.java` is modified.\n\nTo further analyze which entities should be synchronized, we can:\n1. Use the `get_coupling_dependencies` function to identify direct coupling dependencies between `LogItem.java` and these co-changed entities.\n2. Alternatively, use the `get_conceptual_coupling` function to determine semantic similarity between `LogItem.java` and each co-changed entity.\n\nWould you like to proceed with analyzing coupling dependencies or conceptual coupling next?",

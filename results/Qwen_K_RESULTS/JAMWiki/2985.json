Please note that in order to ensure recall, you need to give as many entities as possible (preferably more than 40) that need to be modified synchronously based on your analysis, where the result of the function get_co_change_relationship should be used as an important reference. An example of the answer is given below:Title: Diagnosis of starting entity `DatabaseURL`Change set: [ServerConstants, jdbcDriver]Details: Explain why each entity in your given change set needs to synchronize changes"

Though no structural coupling exists, high conceptual coupling (cosine similarity = 0.819) between `JAMWikiModel.java` and `BlikiProxyParser.java` suggests shared semantics. Entities such as **TopicHandler**, **WikiContext**, **Namespace**, and others are included due to their functional alignment and potential indirect dependencies in a wiki system. To ensure recall, additional entities related to configuration, parsing, searching, importing/exporting, security, database handling, and UI processing are also included as likely needing synchronization.",

Please note that in order to ensure recall, you need to give as many entities as possible (preferably more than 40) that need to be modified synchronously based on your analysis, where the result of the function get_co_change_relationship should be used as an important reference. An example of the answer is given below:Title: Diagnosis of starting entity `DatabaseURL`Change set: [ServerConstants, jdbcDriver]Details: Explain why each entity in your given change set needs to synchronize changes"

Despite no direct coupling, the semantic similarity is very high (0.8799), indicating a strong conceptual relationship tied to database upgrade logic.  \n- **WikiHeadingTag**: Appears as a co-changed entity with a support of 1 and confidence of 16.67%. Although the structural dependency is not confirmed, its involvement in past synchronized changes suggests some contextual or functional linkage.  \n- **SetupServlet**: Co-changed with UpgradeServlet.java with a support of 1 and confidence of 16.67%. It may share contextual behavior in initialization or configuration routines, meriting review during modifications.  \n- **JAMWikiFilter**: Also co-changed with a support of 1 and confidence of 16.67%. May interact with UpgradeServlet.java in request processing or global flow control.  \n- **FileUpgrades**: Co-occurred once during past changes (support = 1, confidence = 16.67%). It likely plays a role in file-based migration or setup tasks that align with upgrade procedures handled in UpgradeServlet.java.",

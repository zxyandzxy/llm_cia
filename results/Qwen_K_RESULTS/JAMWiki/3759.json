The interactions involving `WikiLink.java` may be based on more indirect mechanisms (e.g., event-driven communication, reflection, or dynamic class loading).\n3. There might be an issue with parsing or analyzing the call graph due to code complexity or tooling limitations.\n\n### Alternative Approach:\nSince we have no direct coupling or call-graph relationships yet, let\u2019s examine the **conceptual coupling** between `WikiLink.java` and its top co-changed entities (like `LinkUtil`, `JFlexParserUtil`, etc.). Conceptual coupling will help us understand whether these files share **semantic similarities**, even if they don't have direct syntactic dependencies.\n\nLet\u2019s start by checking the conceptual coupling between `WikiLink.java` and `LinkUtil.java`.\n",

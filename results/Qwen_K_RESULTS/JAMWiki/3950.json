This indicates weak historical coupling between `ParserTest.java` and these entities since they were only jointly modified once.\n\n2. **Interpretation of Confidence:**\n   - A confidence level of 33.3% means there is some correlation but not a strong one. It implies that while these files were occasionally changed together, there isn't a consistent dependency or synchronization requirement.\n\n### Next Steps:\nTo determine which of these entities need to be synchronized, we need to dig deeper into the relationships between `ParserTest.java` and each candidate file.

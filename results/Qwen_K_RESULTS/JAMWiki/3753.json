These files likely share logical or functional dependencies with `ResourceUtil.java`. Changes in `ResourceUtil.java` might necessitate corresponding changes in these files to maintain system consistency.\n\nNext steps:\nTo further analyze the nature of the relationship between `ResourceUtil.java` and `WikiConfiguration.java`, as well as `ResourceUtil.java` and `SpamFilter.java`, I will investigate coupling dependencies. Let\u2019s proceed by calling the `get_coupling_dependencies` function for these pairs. \n\nWould you like me to start with `ResourceUtil.java` and `WikiConfiguration.java`?",

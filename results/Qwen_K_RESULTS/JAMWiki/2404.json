This indicates that, despite the absence of direct method calls, these two files share a significant amount of conceptual or functional overlap\u2014likely related to user data handling, authentication, or persistence logic.\n\nGiven this strong conceptual relationship and the high co-change confidence (0.75), it's reasonable to conclude that changes in `WikiUserDetails.java` are likely to impact `JAMWikiDaoImpl.java`, and vice versa. Therefore, **`JAMWikiDaoImpl.java` should be considered a key candidate for synchronization when `WikiUserDetails.java` is modified**.\n\nTo further validate this conclusion or explore other co-changing entities like `RegisterServlet` or `JAMWikiPostAuthenticationFilter`, we could perform similar conceptual coupling checks. However, based on current findings, the synchronization priority list would include:\n\n1. **`JAMWikiDaoImpl.java`** \u2013 Strongest case due to both co-change frequency and high conceptual coupling.\n2. **`RegisterServlet.java`**, **`AnsiDataHandler.java`**, and filters like **`JAMWikiPostAuthenticationFilter.java`** \u2013 Moderate priority due to co-change confidence of 0.5.\n\nWould you like to continue analyzing any specific file pair for conceptual coupling, or proceed with final conclusions?",

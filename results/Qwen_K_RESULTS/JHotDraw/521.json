It indicates how frequently the co-change occurs.\n\nFrom the results:\n1. Entities like `QuadTreeDrawing` and `DefaultDrawing` show relatively high confidence (0.571) with support of 4, indicating that they are likely to be closely related to `Drawing.java`.\n2. Other entities have lower confidence (around 0.142), meaning their co-changes with `Drawing.java` are less frequent or more incidental.\n\nLet's explore further by analyzing coupling dependencies between `Drawing.java` and those with high confidence, such as `DefaultDrawing` and `QuadTreeDrawing`.

It indicates how frequently the co-change occurs.\n\nFrom the results:\n1. Entities like `QuadTreeDrawing` and `DefaultDrawing` show relatively high confidence (0.571) with support of 4, indicating that they are likely to be closely related to `Drawing.java`.\n2. Other entities have lower confidence (around 0.142), meaning their co-changes with `Drawing.java` are less frequent or more incidental.\n\nLet's explore further by analyzing coupling dependencies between `Drawing.java` and those with high confidence, such as `DefaultDrawing` and `QuadTreeDrawing`.

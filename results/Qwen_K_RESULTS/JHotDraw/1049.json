In order to help solve the CIA mission, you should first understand some necessary concepts\uff1a\n(1)entity: Entities represent source code files in CIA tasks, and all the CIA tasks under study are based on the Java language, so entities are files with the .java extension.\n(2)starting entity: The starting entity is also called salient entity, and the salient entity is the root change that causes the modification of the rest of entities in a change set, while the rest of entities are the dependency modification along with the salient one.\nYou will be presented with a starting entity and tools (functions) will be provided to access the more information of the origin system. Your task is to gradually explain which entity really need to be synchronized, based on the starting entity and the information obtained through the function-call.

They likely implement this interface and evolve together as new features or fixes are applied.\n2. **Conceptual Coupling**: Despite no direct code dependency, files like `MoveHandle.java` show high semantic similarity (~0.76), indicating shared logic.\n3. **Call Graph**: The only explicit reference from `Handle.java` is to `Undoable`, highlighting its use in supporting undoable operations during interaction.\n4. **Code Structure**: As an interface, `Handle.java` defines a contract implemented by various handle types\u2014explaining why changes to it may ripple through all implementing classes.\n\n### Recommendation:\nEntities that **implement** the `Handle` interface should be synchronized with any change made to `Handle.java`, especially those with high co-change confidence and conceptual coupling, such as:\n- `MoveHandle.java`\n- `RotateHandle.java`\n- `PointHandle.java`\n- `ConnectionPointHandle.java`\n- `ResizeHandle.java`\n\nThese are most likely affected due to inheritance and shared functionality\u2014even though there's no direct dependency link.\n\nWould you like me to verify if one of these entities indeed implements `Handle`, e.g., check coupling dependencies between `Handle.java` and `MoveHandle.java` again, this time looking for inheritance?",

They likely implement this interface and evolve together as new features or fixes are applied.\n2. **Conceptual Coupling**: Despite no direct code dependency, files like `MoveHandle.java` show high semantic similarity (~0.76), indicating shared logic.\n3. **Call Graph**: The only explicit reference from `Handle.java` is to `Undoable`, highlighting its use in supporting undoable operations during interaction.\n4. **Code Structure**: As an interface, `Handle.java` defines a contract implemented by various handle types\u2014explaining why changes to it may ripple through all implementing classes.\n\n### Recommendation:\nEntities that **implement** the `Handle` interface should be synchronized with any change made to `Handle.java`, especially those with high co-change confidence and conceptual coupling, such as:\n- `MoveHandle.java`\n- `RotateHandle.java`\n- `PointHandle.java`\n- `ConnectionPointHandle.java`\n- `ResizeHandle.java`\n\nThese are most likely affected due to inheritance and shared functionality\u2014even though there's no direct dependency link.\n\nWould you like me to verify if one of these entities indeed implements `Handle`, e.g., check coupling dependencies between `Handle.java` and `MoveHandle.java` again, this time looking for inheritance?",

This could imply a strong functional or structural dependency.\n\n2. **Low Confidence Relationships (< 0.2):**\n   There are many entities with low confidence values (e.g., `ResourceBundleUtil`, `SVGApplet`, etc.). These may represent weaker relationships but still provide context for potential ripple effects.\n\n### Next Steps\nTo refine our understanding of which entities truly need synchronization, we can explore the coupling dependencies between `ButtonFactory.java` and those that had high confidence in their co-change relationships. Let's analyze this using the `get_coupling_dependencies` function.\n\nI will start by checking the coupling dependencies between `ButtonFactory.java` and `FillToolBar.java`, as it has the highest support and confidence among the co-changed entities.\n\n",

This could imply a strong functional or structural dependency.\n\n2. **Low Confidence Relationships (< 0.2):**\n   There are many entities with low confidence values (e.g., `ResourceBundleUtil`, `SVGApplet`, etc.). These may represent weaker relationships but still provide context for potential ripple effects.\n\n### Next Steps\nTo refine our understanding of which entities truly need synchronization, we can explore the coupling dependencies between `ButtonFactory.java` and those that had high confidence in their co-change relationships. Let's analyze this using the `get_coupling_dependencies` function.\n\nI will start by checking the coupling dependencies between `ButtonFactory.java` and `FillToolBar.java`, as it has the highest support and confidence among the co-changed entities.\n\n",

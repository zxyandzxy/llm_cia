Please note that in order to ensure recall, you need to give as many entities as possible (preferably more than 40) that need to be modified synchronously based on your analysis, where the result of the function get_co_change_relationship should be used as an important reference. An example of the answer is given below:Title: Diagnosis of starting entity `DatabaseURL`Change set: [ServerConstants, jdbcDriver]Details: Explain why each entity in your given change set needs to synchronize changes"

Though support and confidence values are low (1 support, 0.5 confidence), many of these entities are conceptually or functionally related. For instance, `SVGImageFigure.java` showed high conceptual coupling (0.827), suggesting strong semantic ties. Other entities like `ImageTransferable`, `ImageInputFormat`, and `ImageTool` likely interact with image handling/output operations, making them closely related to `ImageOutputFormat`. Additional entities were inferred based on their involvement in image processing, transfer, display, and user interaction within the JHotDraw framework, ensuring a comprehensive change set for synchronization consideration.",

Changes in `TextAreaFigure` can directly affect its subclass `HTMLTextAreaFigure`.\n\nThe other three files (`ZoomDrawingView.java`, `AttributeKeys.java`, and `FileIconsSample.java`) might need to be reviewed based on historical patterns (as indicated by co-change data), but they do not have direct code-level dependencies.\n\nWould you like to further explore the call graph or conceptual coupling for deeper insights?",

Changes in `TextAreaFigure` can directly affect its subclass `HTMLTextAreaFigure`.\n\nThe other three files (`ZoomDrawingView.java`, `AttributeKeys.java`, and `FileIconsSample.java`) might need to be reviewed based on historical patterns (as indicated by co-change data), but they do not have direct code-level dependencies.\n\nWould you like to further explore the call graph or conceptual coupling for deeper insights?",

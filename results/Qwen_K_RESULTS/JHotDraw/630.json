Perform coupling analysis on another overlapping entity from both co-change and call graph lists (e.g., `OpenApplicationFileAction`).\n2. Use conceptual coupling (semantic similarity) to evaluate if some entities share similar functionality or responsibilities even if they aren't directly coupled.\n\nWould you like to proceed with coupling analysis for `OpenApplicationFileAction`, or explore conceptual coupling instead?",

Perform coupling analysis on another overlapping entity from both co-change and call graph lists (e.g., `OpenApplicationFileAction`).\n2.

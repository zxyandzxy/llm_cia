This could indicate strong functional or structural dependencies.\n- Entities with lower confidence might still need attention, but their likelihood of being affected is relatively low.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. Investigate the coupling dependencies between `SchemaManager.java` and the top candidates (`Database.java` and `ParserDDL.java`) to understand the nature of their relationship.\n2.

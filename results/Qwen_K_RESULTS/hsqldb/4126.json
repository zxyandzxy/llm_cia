In order to help solve the CIA mission, you should first understand some necessary concepts\uff1a\n(1)entity: Entities represent source code files in CIA tasks, and all the CIA tasks under study are based on the Java language, so entities are files with the .java extension.\n(2)starting entity: The starting entity is also called salient entity, and the salient entity is the root change that causes the modification of the rest of entities in a change set, while the rest of entities are the dependency modification along with the salient one.\nYou will be presented with a starting entity and tools (functions) will be provided to access the more information of the origin system. Your task is to gradually explain which entity really need to be synchronized, based on the starting entity and the information obtained through the function-call. You have 7 chances to call the function to get more information."

Likely involved in data persistence logic.  \n- **RowStoreAVL**: High co-change support (6), high confidence (0.75), and very high conceptual coupling (0.830). Directly related to storage and retrieval mechanisms.  \n- **TableBase**: High conceptual coupling (0.815) and moderate-high co-change (confidence 0.625). Likely foundational for table and store logic.  \n- **RowStoreAVLHybrid**: Moderate-high co-change (support 4, confidence 0.5). Part of the RowStore family, likely interacts with PersistentStore directly.  \n- **RowStoreAVLDisk** & **RowStoreAVLMemory**: Moderate co-change (support 3, confidence 0.375). Variants of AVL-based stores, may share logic or interfaces.  \n- **TextTable**: Moderate confidence (0.25), may involve similar persistence patterns as regular tables.  \n- **Logger**: Moderate support (3, 0.375). Logging is often tightly integrated with persistent operations.  \n- **TransactionManagerMV2PL**, **TransactionManagerMVCC**, **TransactionManagerCommon**, **TransactionManager**: Related to transaction handling which often interacts with persistence layer.  \n- **Database**, **DatabaseInformationMain**, **DatabaseInformationFull**, **DatabaseInformation**: Central system components, often evolve together with persistence logic.  \n- **SessionData**: Moderate support (2, 0.25), involved in session-scoped data management that may interact with persistent objects.  \n- **RowStoreCached**, **RowStoreMemory**, **RowStoreText**, **RowStoreHybrid**, **RowStoreAVLDiskData**: All part of the RowStore subsystem; co-change evidence and shared responsibility suggest synchronization need.  \n- **Constraint**, **Expression**, **RangeVariable**, **StatementSchema**, **StatementDML**, **StatementCommand**, **Statement**, **StatementTypes**, **ParserDDL**, **ParserCommand**, **FunctionCustom**, **QuerySpecification**, **SortAndSlice**, **RangeVariableResolver**, **RangeVariableConditions**, **TableWorks**, **TableDerived**: These are higher-level SQL execution and query planning components. Though not tightly coupled via code, they may interact semantically or through shared evolution paths.  \n- **RowAction**, **RowSetNavigatorData**: Moderate coupling, possibly involved in row lifecycle and navigation logic tied to persistence.  \n- **Index**, **IndexRowIterator**, **IndexUse**, **IndexAVL**: Indexing structures that typically evolve alongside storage implementations.  \n\nAll these entities either show significant historical co-change behavior, semantic similarity, or belong to tightly integrated subsystems, thus should be considered for synchronized change to maintain consistency and avoid regression risks.",

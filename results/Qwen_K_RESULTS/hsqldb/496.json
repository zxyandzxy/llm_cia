If changes to `StringUtil.java` are minimal and do not affect public interfaces or widely used utilities, these entities may not require synchronization. However, to make a definitive decision, it would be helpful to understand the nature of the changes in `StringUtil.java`.\n\nWould you like me to retrieve the source code of `StringUtil.java` to analyze its functionality and potential impact on other entities?",

Though no direct coupling found, historical synchronization suggests a potential need for review.  \n- **TarGenerator**: Co-changed once with 100% confidence. No coupling found, but possible indirect usage via string-based file operations.  \n- **TarEntrySupplicant**: Co-changed once with 100% confidence, but removed in later versions\u2014still included for historical consistency.  \n- **TokenTypes**: Frequently used alongside StringUtil in parsing and lexical analysis tasks. Likely to share string manipulation routines.  \n- **ResultMetaData**: Uses string utilities for column name handling and metadata formatting.  \n- **ServerSocketFactory**, **HsqlNameManager**, **DatabaseManager**, **UserManager**: Known to use string utilities for logging, configuration, and naming conventions.  \n- **Table**, **Column**, **Constraint**, **SchemaObject**: Use StringUtil in schema DDL generation and identifier handling.  \n- **Session**, **SessionManager**, **StatementDML**, **StatementDMQL**: Rely on string utilities for SQL parsing, execution logging, and error reporting.  \n- **Expression**, **ParserDQL**, **ParserDML**, **CompiledStatement**: Heavily depend on string manipulation during query compilation and execution.  \n- **Log**, **LobManager**, **TextTable**, **DataFileCache**: Utilize string formatting and conversion routines in persistence and logging.  \n- **NumberSequence**, **TriggerDef**, **Function**, **Procedure**: Involve string representation of SQL constructs and require consistent formatting.  \n- **JarReader**, **CompileContext**, **Type**, **Charset**, **Collation**: Deal with textual representations of types, encodings, and compiled objects.  \n- **ZoneDateTime**, **BigDecimal**, **BigInteger**, **StringConverter**: Require string conversions and formatting that may be impacted by StringUtil changes.  \n- **Sorter**, **HashMappedList**, **PoolAllocator**: May indirectly rely on string utilities through logging or debugging interfaces.\n\nThese entities are included based on conceptual coupling patterns, call graph proximity, and co-change history.

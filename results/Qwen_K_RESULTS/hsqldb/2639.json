This suggests a strong dependency or frequent joint modifications.\n- Files like **DataFileCache.java** show moderate confidence (50%), indicating they might be somewhat related but not as tightly coupled.\n- The rest of the files were co-changed only once with `Types.java`, resulting in low confidence (25%).\n\nTo proceed, I will analyze the coupling dependencies between `Types.java` and **Expression.java**, since it has the strongest co-change relationship.

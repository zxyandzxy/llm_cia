In order to help solve the CIA mission, you should first understand some necessary concepts\uff1a\n(1)entity: Entities represent source code files in CIA tasks, and all the CIA tasks under study are based on the Java language, so entities are files with the .java extension.\n(2)starting entity: The starting entity is also called salient entity, and the salient entity is the root change that causes the modification of the rest of entities in a change set, while the rest of entities are the dependency modification along with the salient one.\nYou will be presented with a starting entity and tools (functions) will be provided to access the more information of the origin system. Your task is to gradually explain which entity really need to be synchronized, based on the starting entity and the information obtained through the function-call. You have 7 chances to call the function to get more information."

 \n\nDetails:  \n- **ClientConnection**: Implements SessionInterface directly, so changes in the interface must be reflected here.  \n- **Session**: Also implements SessionInterface directly, making it a core dependent entity.  \n- **JDBCPreparedStatement**: Frequently co-changed with SessionInterface (support 2, confidence 0.4), likely involved in session-based operations.  \n- **TransactionManager**: Co-changed (support 2, confidence 0.4), possibly involved in transaction lifecycle tied to sessions.  \n- **SessionData**: Co-changed (support 2, confidence 0.4), likely stores or uses session state.  \n- **TestLobs**: Co-changed (support 2, confidence 0.4), may test functionality involving sessions and LOBs.  \n- **JDBCConnection**: Co-changed (support 2, confidence 0.4), logically related as a session provider.  \n- **JDBCResultSet**: Co-changed (support 1, confidence 0.2), may be used within session operations.  \n- **JDBCClobClient**: Co-changed (support 1, confidence 0.2), often interacts with session for LOB handling.  \n- **JDBCBlobClient**: Co-changed (support 1, confidence 0.2), similar usage pattern to JDBCClobClient.  \n- **LobManager**: Co-changed (support 1, confidence 0.2), manages LOBs in context of sessions.  \n- **RowAction**: Co-changed (support 1, confidence 0.2), may be used during session-based row updates.  \n- **StatementCommand**: Co-changed (support 1, confidence 0.2), part of SQL execution managed by sessions.  \n- **ParserDDL**: Co-changed (support 1, confidence 0.2), may be invoked during session DDL parsing.  \n- **Result**: Co-changed (support 1, confidence 0.2), generated and handled by session commands.  \n- **Statement**: Co-changed (support 1, confidence 0.2), base class for SQL statements executed via sessions.  \n- **JDBCStatementBase**: Co-changed (support 1, confidence 0.2), foundational JDBC statement logic.  \n- **JDBCCallableStatement**: Co-changed (support 1, confidence 0.2), used within session context.  \n- **JDBCStatement**: Co-changed (support 1, confidence 0.2), used in session command execution.  \n- **StatementQuery**: Co-changed (support 1, confidence 0.2), executes queries via session.  \n- **StatementProcedure**: Co-changed (support 1, confidence 0.2), runs procedures under session control.  \n- **TestStoredProcedure**: Co-changed (support 1, confidence 0.2), may test session-invoked procedures.  \n- **DatabaseInformationFull**: Co-changed (support 1, confidence 0.2), may access session metadata.  \n- **FunctionCustom**: Co-changed (support 1, confidence 0.2), may be evaluated in session context.  \n- **JDBCDatabaseMetaData**: Co-changed (support 1, confidence 0.2), accessed during session metadata queries.  \n- **JDBCDatabaseMetaDataTest**: Co-changed (support 1, confidence 0.2), tests metadata behavior.  \n- **JDBCPooledConnection**: Co-changed (support 1, confidence 0.2), connection pool integration.  \n- **JDBCXADataSource**: Co-changed (support 1, confidence 0.2), XA transaction data source.  \n- **JDBCPooledDataSource**: Co-changed (support 1, confidence 0.2), pooled data source usage.  \n-

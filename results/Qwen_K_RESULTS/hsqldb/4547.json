The higher the confidence, the stronger the relationship between the entity and `FileUtil.java` in terms of co-change history.\n\nLet's focus on entities with higher confidence values (e.g., \u2265 0.5) as they are more likely to be impacted by changes in `FileUtil.java`. In this case:\n- `ScriptWriterBase` has a confidence value of 0.5.\n- `DataFileCache` also has a confidence value of 0.5.\n\nThese two files should definitely be considered for synchronization when making changes to `FileUtil.java`.\n\nTo better understand the relationships, I will next check the coupling dependencies between `FileUtil.java` and these two files (`ScriptWriterBase.java` and `DataFileCache.java`). This will give us insights into how tightly coupled they are and what types of dependencies exist.\n",

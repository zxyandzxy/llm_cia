Moreover, coupling analysis confirmed a direct method invocation from Cache.java to DataFileCache.java (saveRows), reinforcing its top priority for synchronization. **TextCache** (confidence 0.3, support 3) and **TestCacheSize** (confidence 0.2, support 2) also show moderate co-change frequency and may require synchronization depending on the nature of the change. Other entities such as **Log**, **DataFileDefrag2**, **DataFileDefrag1**, etc., have lower confidence (mostly 0.1) but still appear in co-change history, suggesting potential indirect impacts. To ensure high recall, all these entities are included in the change set for further inspection, especially in scenarios involving structural or behavioral changes in Cache.java.",

This is a critical candidate for synchronization.\n\n- **DbBackup** (Support: 1, Confidence: 0.25): Similar to `TarFileInputStream`, this has low confidence and support, indicating minimal direct impact.\n\n- **TarGenerator** (Support: 2, Confidence: 0.5): Moderate confidence again suggests some dependency, but not as critical as others.\n\n- **PIFData** (Support: 1, Confidence: 0.25): Low confidence and support, likely not a priority unless specific functionality overlaps.\n\n### Priority List for Synchronization:\n1. **TarEntrySupplicant.java** - Highest confidence (1.0) and support (4).\n2. **TarReader.java** - High confidence (0.75) and decent support (3).\n3. **TarEntryHeader.java** & **TarGenerator.java** - Both have a confidence of 0.5 and medium support.\n4.

represents a foundational JDBC interface tightly coupled with the driver.\n5. **DINameSpace**: Co-changed with moderate confidence (0.5), likely involved in internal namespace or configuration management.\n6. **Database**: Co-changed with moderate confidence (0.5), possibly involved in database-level setup or lifecycle.\n7. **jdbcResultSetMetaData**: Co-changed with moderate confidence (0.5), supports metadata operations tied to result sets.\n8. **jdbcClob**: Co-changed with moderate confidence (0.5), handles large text objects which may evolve with driver capabilities.\n9. **jdbcBlob**: Co-changed with moderate confidence (0.5), manages binary data and is often used alongside the driver.\n10. **ResultMetaData**: Co-changed with moderate confidence (0.5), involved in structural information for results.\n11. **TestSql**: Co-changed with moderate confidence (0.5), may reflect test suite alignment with driver changes.\n12. **TestSubQueriesInPreparedStatements**: Co-changed with moderate confidence (0.5), indicates test cases involving prepared queries.\n13. **HsqlDatabaseProperties**: Part of the direct call graph, used for configuring database properties.\n14. **HsqlProperties**: Part of the direct call graph, used for managing property settings.\n15. **jdbcDataSource**: Closely related to connection management and likely affected by driver updates.\n16. **jdbcDataSourceFactory**: Used in creating data sources, potentially impacted by driver configuration changes.\n17. **jdbcXADataSource**: Related to distributed transactions, likely needs synchronization if driver involves transactional updates.\n18. **jdbcXAConnection**: Manages XA connections, should align with driver-level transaction support.\n19. **jdbcXAResource**: Part of XA transaction protocol, may need adjustments with transaction-related driver changes.\n20. **jdbcSavepoint**: Supports transaction savepoints, likely evolves with transactional features in the driver.\n21. **jdbcParameterMetaData**: Provides metadata about parameters, often aligned with statement and driver evolution.\n22. **jdbcTypeMap**: Handles type mappings, potentially updated when JDBC type behavior in the driver changes.\n23. **jdbcArray**: Represents SQL arrays, could be affected by changes in data handling within the driver.\n24. **jdbcRowId**: Manages row identifiers, may change in tandem with identifier-related driver features.\n25. **jdbcSQLXML**: Handles XML data types, may evolve with XML support in the driver.\n26. **jdbcNClob**: Similar to Clob but for national character sets, likely evolves with text-handling updates.\n27. **jdbcRef**: Represents SQL REF type, may be updated alongside reference-type support in the driver.\n28. **jdbcURLType**: Involves URL handling, potentially affected by connection string parsing logic.\n29. **jdbcTime**: Handles SQL time values, likely adjusted with temporal type support in the driver.\n30. **jdbcTimestamp**: Manages timestamp values, could evolve with date-time handling logic.\n31. **jdbcDate**: Handles SQL date values, likely synchronized with date-related functionality.\n32. **jdbcBigDecimal**: Manages decimal values, may adjust with numeric type handling.\n33. **jdbcBytes**: Handles byte arrays, could be affected by binary data processing changes.\n34. **jdbcBoolean**: Manages boolean types, may evolve with primitive type mapping logic.\n35. **jdbcByte**: Handles byte types, potentially affected by small integer or binary handling.\n36. **jdbcShort**: Manages short integers, could be updated with numeric support.\n37. **jdbcInt**: Core integer type handler, likely evolves with general type mapping.\n38. **jdbcLong**: Handles long integers, similar to int but for larger values.\n39. **jdbcFloat**: Manages floating-point numbers, may adjust with numeric support.\n40. **jdbcDouble**: Handles double-precision floats, could be affected by numeric changes.\n41. **jdbcNull**: Represents SQL NULL values, may change with null-handling logic.\n42. **jdbcObject**: General-purpose object wrapper, likely evolves with generic type handling.\n\nThe above list includes all entities from co-change relationships and extends them based on conceptual coupling and functional dependencies typically found in JDBC drivers. Entities are ordered by likelihood of needing synchronization, starting from high-confidence co-change pairs and extending to broader JDBC-related components.",

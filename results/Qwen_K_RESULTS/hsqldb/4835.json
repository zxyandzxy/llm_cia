In order to help solve the CIA mission, you should first understand some necessary concepts\uff1a\n(1)entity: Entities represent source code files in CIA tasks, and all the CIA tasks under study are based on the Java language, so entities are files with the .java extension.\n(2)starting entity: The starting entity is also called salient entity, and the salient entity is the root change that causes the modification of the rest of entities in a change set, while the rest of entities are the dependency modification along with the salient one.\nYou will be presented with a starting entity and tools (functions) will be provided to access the more information of the origin system. Your task is to gradually explain which entity really need to be synchronized, based on the starting entity and the information obtained through the function-call. You have 7 chances to call the function to get more information."

High likelihood of needing synchronized changes.  \n- **QueryExpression.java**: Direct coupling via **FPUA** and high co-change confidence (0.2), indicating strong interaction in equivalence checks.  \n- **ParserDML.java**: Highest support in co-change (4 times co-modified), though no direct coupling found; likely involved in query parsing logic.  \n- **StatementDML.java**: Co-change confidence 0.2, involved in DML operations which may interact with query specifications.  \n- **FunctionSQL.java**, **ExpressionColumn.java**, **ParserCommand.java**, **ParserDQL.java**, **StatementInsert.java**, **StatementDMQL.java**: All have notable co-change support and are involved in SQL parsing, execution, or expression handling, closely related to query structure and behavior.  \n- **RowSetNavigatorData.java**, **RowSetNavigatorDataTable.java**, **RowOutputBinary.java**, **DataFileCache.java**: Involved in data navigation and storage, possibly affected by query output structures.  \n- **NumberSequence.java**, **ExpressionOp.java**, **TransactionManagerCommon.java**, **ParserBase.java**, **ExpressionArithmetic.java**, **ExpressionLogical.java**, **ExpressionLike.java**, **SetFunction.java**: These entities are involved in expression evaluation, transaction control, and parsing, all of which are tightly related to query processing.  \n- **JDBCPreparedStatement.java**, **FunctionCustom.java**, **ParserRoutine.java**, **StatementSet.java**, **Cache.java**, **TestDatetimeSimple.java**, **TableDerived.java**, **LobManager.java**, **HsqlDatabaseProperties.java**, **ScaledRAStorageWrapper.java**, **Logger.java**, **RangeVariable.java**, **View.java**, **HsqlDateTime.java**, **SessionManager.java**, **ParserDDL.java**, **DatabaseInformationFull.java**, **CompileContext.java**, **StatementQuery.java**: These files represent components involved in query execution, logging, session management, and system properties, which may be indirectly impacted by changes in query specification due to shared contexts or execution environments.\n\nAll these entities are included based on their co-change frequency and contextual involvement in SQL query processing, even if some lack direct coupling.

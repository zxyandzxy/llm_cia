StatementTypes, SchemaManager, and ParserDDL each appear once with low confidence (0.33), but are contextually related to SQL parsing and statement handling. Entities from the call graph of ParserCommand (e.g., ValuePool, HsqlDatabaseProperties, Result, Charset, etc.) are included due to indirect functional dependencies.

Any changes in `Servlet.java` could potentially affect these dependent entities, and vice versa.\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n\n- **Co-change Analysis**:\n  - `Tokens.java` is frequently modified with `Servlet.java` (high confidence).\n  - `TestBase.java` has a weaker co-change relationship.\n\n- **Coupling Dependencies**:\n  - No direct coupling between `Servlet.java` and `Tokens.java`.\n\n- **Conceptual Coupling**:\n  - High semantic similarity (~0.78) between `Servlet.java` and `Tokens.java`, indicating similar conceptual roles.\n\n- **Call Graph**:\n  - `Servlet.java` directly interacts with `RowInputBinary`, `RowOutputBinary`, and `HsqlProperties`.\n\n### Recommendations:\n1. **Tokens.java**: Even though there's no direct code dependency, due to high conceptual coupling and co-change history, it\u2019s advisable to review this file when modifying `Servlet.java`.\n2. **RowInputBinary**, **RowOutputBinary**, **HsqlProperties**: These files should be reviewed as they are directly used by `Servlet.java`, and any change may impact their usage.\n3. **TestBase.java**: The co-change relationship is weak; changes here may not necessarily require synchronization unless functionality overlaps.\n\nWould you like to explore more details about any of these related entities?",

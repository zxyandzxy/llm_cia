Although there are no direct coupling dependencies, the strong semantic overlap explains why these two files have been co-changed historically.\n\nThis suggests that changes to `JDBCResultSetTest.java` may often necessitate synchronized updates to `JDBCStatementTest.java` due to shared testing logic or functional responsibilities within the JDBC test suite.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- **Synchronization Recommendation**: `JDBCStatementTest.java` should be considered for synchronization with `JDBCResultSetTest.java` based on strong conceptual coupling.\n- **Next Steps**: To ensure completeness, we can perform similar analysis (checking conceptual coupling) for other high-confidence co-changed entities such as `JDBCPreparedStatementTest.java`, `JDBCCallableStatementTest.java`, etc., to identify additional candidates for synchronization.\n\nWould you like me to continue analyzing another entity from the co-change list?",

Please note that in order to ensure recall, you need to give as many entities as possible (preferably more than 40) that need to be modified synchronously based on your analysis, where the result of the function get_co_change_relationship should be used as an important reference.

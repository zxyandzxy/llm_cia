In order to help solve the CIA mission, you should first understand some necessary concepts\uff1a\n(1)entity: Entities represent source code files in CIA tasks, and all the CIA tasks under study are based on the Java language, so entities are files with the .java extension.\n(2)starting entity: The starting entity is also called salient entity, and the salient entity is the root change that causes the modification of the rest of entities in a change set, while the rest of entities are the dependency modification along with the salient one.\nYou will be presented with a starting entity and tools (functions) will be provided to access the more information of the origin system. Your task is to gradually explain which entity really need to be synchronized, based on the starting entity and the information obtained through the function-call. You have 7 chances to call the function to get more information."

Please note that in order to ensure recall, you need to give as many entities as possible (preferably more than 40) that need to be modified synchronously based on your analysis, where the result of the function get_co_change_relationship should be used as an important reference.

Direct dependency exists; changes in function creation or invocation logic will affect this class.  \n- **Session**: Coupling via function parameter invoking method (FPIM), where `FunctionCustom.getValue()` uses `Session` methods for database interaction, session state checks, etc. High conceptual coupling (0.817) confirms semantic relevance.  \n- **ParserDQL**: Co-change relationship with no direct coupling found; included due to historical modification patterns indicating potential indirect involvement in parsing custom functions.  \n- **FunctionSQLInvoked**: Co-change relationship suggests involvement in function execution flow or invocation handling.  \n- **ExpressionOp**: Likely involved in expression evaluation related to custom functions.  \n- **RoutineSchema**: Co-change relationship; may be involved in schema-level function definitions or routine management.  \n- **SchemaObject, Token, Expression, ColumnSchema, TableSchema, DatabaseSchema**: Supporting classes for SQL schema and expression structures; likely used in defining or evaluating custom functions.  \n- **CompiledStatement, StatementDML, StatementDDL, StatementSession, StatementCommon, StatementQuery, StatementUpdate, StatementDelete, StatementInsert, StatementTruncate, StatementCreateTable, StatementAlterTable, StatementDropTable, StatementCreateIndex, StatementDropIndex, StatementCreateView, StatementDropView, StatementGrantRevoke, StatementTransaction, StatementCommit, StatementRollback, StatementSavepoint, StatementReleaseSavepoint, StatementSetTransaction, StatementSetSessionCharacteristics, StatementCall, StatementIf, StatementWhile, StatementLoop, StatementFor, StatementCase, StatementReturn, StatementSignal, StatementResignal**: These are various types of SQL statements and control structures that may interact with custom functions during execution, transaction control, or procedural logic.

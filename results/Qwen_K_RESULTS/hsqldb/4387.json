In order to help solve the CIA mission, you should first understand some necessary concepts\uff1a\n(1)entity: Entities represent source code files in CIA tasks, and all the CIA tasks under study are based on the Java language, so entities are files with the .java extension.\n(2)starting entity: The starting entity is also called salient entity, and the salient entity is the root change that causes the modification of the rest of entities in a change set, while the rest of entities are the dependency modification along with the salient one.\nYou will be presented with a starting entity and tools (functions) will be provided to access the more information of the origin system. Your task is to gradually explain which entity really need to be synchronized, based on the starting entity and the information obtained through the function-call. You have 7 chances to call the function to get more information."

Examples include methods like `compileAlter`, `compileDrop`, `compileCreateTableBody`, and many others.\n\n3. **Constructor Invoking (CMI)**:\n   - Multiple instances where `new StatementSchema(...)` is invoked in `ParserDDL.java` to create `StatementSchema` objects with different parameters for various SQL operations.\n\n4. **Method Member Variable Invoking Method (MMAIM)**:\n   - In method `compileCreateSchema`, there is a direct call to a member method on a `StatementSchema` instance.\n\nGiven this strong coupling, any changes in `ParserDDL.java` can significantly affect `StatementSchema.java`, and vice versa. Therefore, **`StatementSchema.java` should be synchronized** when modifying `ParserDDL.java`.\n\n---\n\nNext, I will examine the coupling dependencies between `ParserDDL.java` and another co-changed entity, `HsqlDatabaseProperties.java`, to determine if it also requires synchronization.\n",

Here's a summary of the key findings:\n\n### Coupling Dependencies:\n1. **Return Type (RT)**: \n   - Numerous methods in `ParserDDL.java` return instances of `StatementSchema`, such as `compileCreate`, `compileCreateTable`, `compileCreateView`, etc.\n   \n2. **Method Member Variable Usage Variable (MMAUA)**:\n   - There are multiple usages of `StatementSchema` objects created and used directly within various methods in `ParserDDL.java`. Examples include methods like `compileAlter`, `compileDrop`, `compileCreateTableBody`, and many others.\n\n3. **Constructor Invoking (CMI)**:\n   - Multiple instances where `new StatementSchema(...)` is invoked in `ParserDDL.java` to create `StatementSchema` objects with different parameters for various SQL operations.\n\n4. **Method Member Variable Invoking Method (MMAIM)**:\n   - In method `compileCreateSchema`, there is a direct call to a member method on a `StatementSchema` instance.\n\nGiven this strong coupling, any changes in `ParserDDL.java` can significantly affect `StatementSchema.java`, and vice versa. Therefore, **`StatementSchema.java` should be synchronized** when modifying `ParserDDL.java`.\n\n---\n\nNext, I will examine the coupling dependencies between `ParserDDL.java` and another co-changed entity, `HsqlDatabaseProperties.java`, to determine if it also requires synchronization.\n",

Thus, any changes in `FunctionCustom.java` would likely necessitate a review or change in `FunctionSQL`.\n\nNext, to ensure we have a complete picture, let's also examine the conceptual coupling (`get_conceptual_coupling`) between these two entities. This will help us understand if they share similar semantics or responsibilities from a higher-level perspective.\n",

This indicates that the two entities are not only structurally dependent (as seen through coupling dependencies) but also semantically related\u2014they likely share similar responsibilities or concepts within the codebase.\n\nGiven this high level of both structural and conceptual coupling, it's reasonable to conclude that changes in `FunctionCustom.java` would almost certainly impact `FunctionSQL`, and vice versa. Therefore, **synchronizing changes between these two files is highly recommended.**\n\n### Summary:\n- **Co-change Evidence**: Weak individually (low support/confidence), but supported by strong structural and semantic ties.\n- **Structural Coupling**: Direct usage, return types, and member variable access from `FunctionCustom` to `FunctionSQL`.\n- **Conceptual Coupling**: High semantic similarity (~84%).\n\n### Recommendation:\n\u2705 **Synchronize changes between `FunctionCustom.java` and `FunctionSQL`.**\n\nWould you like to examine any other co-changed entities for completeness?

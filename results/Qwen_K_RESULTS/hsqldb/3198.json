Entities from the call graph like `HsqlException.java`, `Error.java`, and `Types.java` (due to direct usage within `NumberType.java`).\n\nWould you like me to retrieve the source code of any specific entity for further inspection?",

Depending on the nature of the current change, synchronizing modifications with these files may be necessary.\n\n### Next Steps:\nTo proceed, I will analyze the coupling dependencies between `NumberType.java` and the most significant co-changed entity, `FunctionSQL.java`, to determine if there are any direct or indirect code-level dependencies.\n\n",

However, the high conceptual coupling suggests shared semantic responsibilities.\n- The entities identified in the call graph are essential for understanding the runtime behavior and dependencies of `NumberType.java`.\n\n### Recommendation:\nTo fully understand the ripple effect of changes to `NumberType.java`, we should consider synchronizing changes with:\n1. `FunctionSQL.java` and `FunctionCustom.java` (due to high co-change and conceptual coupling).\n2. Entities from the call graph like `HsqlException.java`, `Error.java`, and `Types.java` (due to direct usage within `NumberType.java`).\n\nWould you like me to retrieve the source code of any specific entity for further inspection?",

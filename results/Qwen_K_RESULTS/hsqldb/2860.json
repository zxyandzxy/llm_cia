Here's a breakdown of the results:\n\n### Co-Change Relationships\n1. **Strongest Synchronization (Confidence = 1.0):**\n   - `ClobDataID` (Support: 4 times).\n     This indicates that whenever `ClobData.java` was modified, `ClobDataID` was consistently modified as well. Therefore, it **must be synchronized**.\n\n2. **High Synchronization (Confidence \u2265 0.75):**\n   - `BlobDataID` (Support: 3 times, Confidence: 0.75).\n   - `LobManager` (Support: 3 times, Confidence: 0.75).\n   - `CharacterType` (Support: 3 times, Confidence: 0.75).\n     These files are frequently changed together with `ClobData.java`. They likely share closely related functionalities and should also be considered for synchronization.\n\n3. **Moderate Synchronization (Confidence between 0.5 and 0.75):**\n   - `BinaryData` (Support: 2 times, Confidence: 0.5).\n   - `BlobData` (Support: 2 times, Confidence: 0.5).\n   - `ResultLob` (Support: 2 times, Confidence: 0.5).\n   - `Session` (Support: 2 times, Confidence: 0.5).\n   - `BinaryType` (Support: 2 times, Confidence: 0.5).\n     These files show moderate correlation in change history. It would be prudent to review them for potential synchronization.\n\n4. **Low Synchronization (Confidence < 0.5):**\n   - Others like `Database`, `ClobDataRemoteClient`, `JDBCResultSet`, etc., show lower confidence scores.\n     These may not require immediate synchronization but should still be reviewed if there\u2019s contextual or functional dependency.\n\n### Next Steps\nSince `ClobDataID` has the highest priority for synchronization, I will retrieve more information about its coupling dependencies with `ClobData.java` to validate their interdependence. \n\nLet me proceed by calling the function `get_coupling_dependencies(ClobData.java, ClobDataID)`.\n",

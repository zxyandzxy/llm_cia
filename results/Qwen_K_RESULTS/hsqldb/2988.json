Therefore, synchronizing changes between these two entities is crucial.\n\n### Next Steps:\nTo further analyze potential ripple effects, I will examine what other entities use `RowActionBase.java` by leveraging the `get_call_graph` function.

Any change in the structure or behavior of RowActionBase will have a direct impact on RowAction, as confirmed by coupling analysis and co-change data with high confidence (support=2, confidence=1.0).  \n- **Session**: Frequently co-changed with RowActionBase (support=1, confidence=0.5). As RowActionBase holds a reference to Session and is involved in transactional operations, any changes affecting session handling would likely require synchronized updates here.  \n- **Table**: Co-changed with RowActionBase historically (support=1, confidence=0.5). Table operations often involve row-level actions and transactions, suggesting tight functional integration.  \n- **LobManager**: Appears in co-change history (support=1, confidence=0.5). Likely due to involvement in large object handling during transactional row operations.  \n- **Error**: Appears in co-change history (support=1, confidence=0.5). May be involved in error handling related to transaction or constraint violations during row actions.  \n- **ClientConnection**: Co-changed once with RowActionBase (confidence=0.5). Could relate to client-side transaction management or response handling.  \n- **ParserDDL**: Co-changed once (confidence=0.5). Might relate to schema change logging or DDL triggering row actions.  \n- **TransactionManagerCommon**: Part of transaction management infrastructure (support=1, confidence=0.5), and may coordinate with RowActionBase for commit/rollback operations.  \n- **TransactionManagerMVCC**: Co-changed once (confidence=0.5). MVCC-based transaction logic could interact with row action timestamps and visibility rules.  \n- **TransactionManagerMV2PL**: Also co-changed once (confidence=0.5). Two-phase locking manager may coordinate with row actions for concurrency control.  \n\nThese entities are included based on historical co-change evidence and their conceptual or structural ties to transaction and row-level action management in HSQLDB.",

Therefore, synchronizing changes between these two entities is crucial.\n\n### Next Steps:\nTo further analyze potential ripple effects, I will examine what other entities use `RowActionBase.java` by leveraging the `get_call_graph` function. This will reveal additional dependencies such as method calls or variable references, helping identify more entities that might be affected by changes to `RowActionBase.java`.\n",

Since there are no apparent call-graph-based dependencies, we can focus on the inheritance chain and co-change patterns to determine synchronization needs.\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n- `RowActionBase.java` is tightly coupled with `RowAction.java` via **inheritance**.\n- The co-change analysis shows a strong historical correlation between changes to `RowActionBase.java` and `RowAction.java` (support = 2, confidence = 1.0).\n- No other direct usage-based dependencies (method calls or variable references) were found.\n\n### Final Step:\nTo ensure completeness, I will examine the source code of `RowActionBase.java` using the `get_origin_code` function. This will help validate the structure of the class and potentially reveal any additional insights about its role in the system.\n",

Any change in the structure or behavior of RowActionBase will have a direct impact on RowAction, as confirmed by coupling analysis and co-change data with high confidence (support=2, confidence=1.0).  \n- **Session**: Frequently co-changed with RowActionBase (support=1, confidence=0.5). As RowActionBase holds a reference to Session and is involved in transactional operations, any changes affecting session handling would likely require synchronized updates here.  \n- **Table**: Co-changed with RowActionBase historically (support=1, confidence=0.5). Table operations often involve row-level actions and transactions, suggesting tight functional integration.  \n- **LobManager**: Appears in co-change history (support=1, confidence=0.5). Likely due to involvement in large object handling during transactional row operations.  \n- **Error**: Appears in co-change history (support=1, confidence=0.5). May be involved in error handling related to transaction or constraint violations during row actions.  \n- **ClientConnection**: Co-changed once with RowActionBase (confidence=0.5). Could relate to client-side transaction management or response handling.  \n- **ParserDDL**: Co-changed once (confidence=0.5). Might relate to schema change logging or DDL triggering row actions.  \n- **TransactionManagerCommon**: Part of transaction management infrastructure (support=1, confidence=0.5), and may coordinate with RowActionBase for commit/rollback operations.  \n- **TransactionManagerMVCC**: Co-changed once (confidence=0.5). MVCC-based transaction logic could interact with row action timestamps and visibility rules.  \n- **TransactionManagerMV2PL**: Also co-changed once (confidence=0.5). Two-phase locking manager may coordinate with row actions for concurrency control.  \n\nThese entities are included based on historical co-change evidence and their conceptual or structural ties to transaction and row-level action management in HSQLDB.",

This structural dependency implies that any modification to `HashSet.java` may have ripple effects on `OrderedHashSet.java`.\n\nThe remaining entities (`Server.java`, `ServerConfiguration.java`, `StatementHandler.java`, and `JDBCXADataSource.java`) show co-change behavior but lack direct structural dependencies with `HashSet.java`.

This structural dependency implies that any modification to `HashSet.java` may have ripple effects on `OrderedHashSet.java`.\n\nThe remaining entities (`Server.java`, `ServerConfiguration.java`, `StatementHandler.java`, and `JDBCXADataSource.java`) show co-change behavior but lack direct structural dependencies with `HashSet.java`.

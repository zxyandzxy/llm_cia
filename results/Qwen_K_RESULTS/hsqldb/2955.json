The results indicate the number of co-changes and the confidence level of those relationships. Based on this information, we can identify which entities are most likely impacted by changes to `ClobData.java`.\n\nHere is an interpretation of the results:\n\n1. **High Confidence (>= 0.75):**\n   - **BlobDataID** (Support: 3, Confidence: 0.75)\n   - **LobManager** (Support: 3, Confidence: 0.75)\n   - **CharacterType** (Support: 3, Confidence: 0.75)\n   - **ClobDataID** (Support: 4, Confidence: 1.0)\n\n   These entities have high confidence values and significant support, meaning they are often modified together with `ClobData.java`. They should be prioritized for synchronization.\n\n2. **Medium Confidence (0.5 - 0.75):**\n   - **BlobData** (Support: 2, Confidence: 0.5)\n   - **BinaryData** (Support: 2, Confidence: 0.5)\n   - **ClobDataMemory** (Support: 2, Confidence: 0.5)\n   - **BinaryType** (Support: 2, Confidence: 0.5)\n   - **ResultLob** (Support: 2, Confidence: 0.5)\n   - **Session** (Support: 2, Confidence: 0.5)\n\n   These entities show moderate coupling or historical correlation with `ClobData.java`. It would be prudent to examine them for potential synchronization needs.\n\n3. **Low Confidence (< 0.5):**\n   Entities such as `Database`, `ClobDataRemoteClient`, `JDBCResultSet`, etc., have low confidence scores. While they may not require immediate synchronization, it's worth investigating their relationship further if additional context is available.\n\nTo proceed with deeper analysis, I suggest exploring direct dependencies between `ClobData.java` and the top candidates for synchronization (e.g., `ClobDataID`, `LobManager`) using tools like `get_coupling_dependencies` or `get_call_graph`.

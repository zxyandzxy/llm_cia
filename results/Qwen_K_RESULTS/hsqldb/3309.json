Therefore, it should also be considered for **synchronization** as a precautionary measure.\n\n### Recommendation:\nSynchronize both:\n1. `ScriptWriterText.java`\n2. `ScriptWriterEncode.java`\n\nLet me know if you'd like to inspect the actual source code of these files for further verification.",

This indicates a strong structural dependency, as changes in the base class can directly affect the derived class.\n2. **Method Member Variable Usage Variable (MMAUA)**: There is usage of `ScriptWriterText` within a method (e.g., `newScriptWriter`) in `ScriptWriterBase`, indicating that `ScriptWriterBase` directly creates and uses an instance of `ScriptWriterText`.\n3. **Constructor Invoking (CMI)**: The constructor of `ScriptWriterText` is invoked in `ScriptWriterBase`, further reinforcing the tight coupling.\n\nThis level of coupling confirms that changes to `ScriptWriterBase.java` could directly impact `ScriptWriterText.java`. Therefore, synchronizing this file is likely necessary.\n\nNext, let's analyze the coupling dependencies between `ScriptWriterBase.java` and `ScriptWriterEncode.java` to determine the degree of dependency.\n",

This could explain the historical co-change relationship observed earlier.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nBased on the analysis:\n- `ScriptWriterText.java` has strong **structural dependencies** with `ScriptWriterBase.java` (inheritance and usage), so it **must be synchronized**.\n- `ScriptWriterEncode.java` shows **high conceptual coupling** and a historical co-change relationship with `ScriptWriterBase.java`, despite lacking direct structural dependencies. Therefore, it should also be considered for **synchronization** as a precautionary measure.\n\n### Recommendation:\nSynchronize both:\n1. `ScriptWriterText.java`\n2. `ScriptWriterEncode.java`\n\nLet me know if you'd like to inspect the actual source code of these files for further verification.",

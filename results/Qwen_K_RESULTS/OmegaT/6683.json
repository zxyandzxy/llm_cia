We can also investigate these further by analyzing their coupling dependencies or call graphs to validate the relationships.\n\nWould you like me to analyze one of these high-confidence entities next? If so, please specify which one.",

Please note that in order to ensure recall, you need to give as many entities as possible (preferably more than 40) that need to be modified synchronously based on your analysis, where the result of the function get_co_change_relationship should be used as an important reference.

Entities such as `AbstractFilter`, `POFilterTest`, and `TestFilterBase` exhibit the highest confidence (0.4286), indicating frequent co-changes and likely strong dependencies. Medium-confidence entities like `ParseEntry`, `IParseCallback`, `FilterVisitor`, `HTMLFilter2`, `ResourceBundleFilter`, and `PoOptionsDialog` also show notable coupling and should be included in the change set. Lower-confidence entities are retained to ensure recall is maximized, as they may still represent relevant dependencies.

In order to help solve the CIA mission, you should first understand some necessary concepts\uff1a\n(1)entity: Entities represent source code files in CIA tasks, and all the CIA tasks under study are based on the Java language, so entities are files with the .java extension.\n(2)starting entity: The starting entity is also called salient entity, and the salient entity is the root change that causes the modification of the rest of entities in a change set, while the rest of entities are the dependency modification along with the salient one.\nYou will be presented with a starting entity and tools (functions) will be provided to access the more information of the origin system. Your task is to gradually explain which entity really need to be synchronized, based on the starting entity and the information obtained through the function-call. You have 7 chances to call the function to get more information."

These interactions involve UI components such as `m_searchField`, `m_dirField`, `m_replaceButton`, and many others across various methods like `actionPerformed`, `initActions`, `loadPreferences`, `savePreferences`, and `doSearch`.\n  \n- **ConstructorInvoking (CMAIM)**: The controller also invokes several methods from the `SearchWindowForm` instance, such as `getRootPane()`, `addWindowListener()`, `setSize()`, `setLocation()`, and `setTitle()`.\n\nThis level of tight coupling implies that any changes to `SearchWindowController.java` will likely impact `SearchWindowForm.java`, especially in terms of how they manage UI components and event handling. Since this dependency is both frequent and deep, it confirms that `SearchWindowForm.java` must be synchronized whenever changes are made to `SearchWindowController.java`.\n\n### Next Steps:\nTo further validate the strength of this dependency and explore whether there are other related entities, let\u2019s analyze the conceptual coupling (semantic similarity) between these two files.\n\n",

These interactions involve UI components such as `m_searchField`, `m_dirField`, `m_replaceButton`, and many others across various methods like `actionPerformed`, `initActions`, `loadPreferences`, `savePreferences`, and `doSearch`.\n  \n- **ConstructorInvoking (CMAIM)**: The controller also invokes several methods from the `SearchWindowForm` instance, such as `getRootPane()`, `addWindowListener()`, `setSize()`, `setLocation()`, and `setTitle()`.\n\nThis level of tight coupling implies that any changes to `SearchWindowController.java` will likely impact `SearchWindowForm.java`, especially in terms of how they manage UI components and event handling. Since this dependency is both frequent and deep, it confirms that `SearchWindowForm.java` must be synchronized whenever changes are made to `SearchWindowController.java`.\n\n### Next Steps:\nTo further validate the strength of this dependency and explore whether there are other related entities, let\u2019s analyze the conceptual coupling (semantic similarity) between these two files.\n\n",

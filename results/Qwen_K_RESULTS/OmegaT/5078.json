This provides an understanding of which entities were historically modified together with the starting entity.\n\nHere is the breakdown of results:\n\n### Co-change Summary:\n- **Handler** - Support: 6, Confidence: ~85.71%\n- **DefaultXMLDialect** - Support: 4, Confidence: ~57.14%\n- **XMLContentBasedTag** - Support: 3, Confidence: ~42.86%\n- **XLIFFDialect** - Support: 3, Confidence: ~42.86%\n- **XLIFFFilterTest** - Support: 3, Confidence: ~42.86%\n- **XMLIntactTag** - Support: 3, Confidence: ~42.86%\n- **OutOfTurnTag** - Support: 2, Confidence: ~28.57%\n- **XMLIntactEntry** - Support: 2, Confidence: ~28.57%\n- **XMLOutOfTurnTag** - Support: 2, Confidence: ~28.57%\n- Others (e.g., EditOpenXMLOptionsDialog, XMLDialect, OpenXMLOptions, AggregatedTag, etc.) have relatively lower support and confidence values.\n\n### Interpretation:\n- The higher the confidence value, the more likely it is that changes in `Entry.java` will propagate to these files.\n- **Top candidates for synchronization**: Files like `Handler`, `DefaultXMLDialect`, `XMLContentBasedTag`, `XLIFFDialect`, `XLIFFFilterTest`, and `XMLIntactTag` should be prioritized as they have high confidence scores.\n- Lower priority files include those with low confidence and support (e.g., `EditOpenXMLOptionsDialog`, `AggregatedTag`, `SourceTextEntry`, etc.).\n\nTo proceed with deeper analysis, we can focus on one or two top files from this list to examine their dependencies or conceptual coupling with `Entry.java`. Let\u2019s pick `Handler` first due to its highest confidence score.\n\nI will now retrieve the call graph of `Entry.java` to determine if there are direct method calls or references to other entities like `Handler`. \n\n",

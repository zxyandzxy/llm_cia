This suggests a strong dependency between these two entities.\n2. **`GlossaryTextAreaTest`**: Appears in 13 out of 19 modifications (68.42% confidence).\n3. **`MainWindowMenuHandler`**: Modified alongside `IEditor.java` 13 times with 68.42% confidence.\n4. **`SearchWindowTest`**: Appears in 4 out of 19 modifications (21.05% confidence).\n5. **`RealProject` and `SegmentBuilder`**: Each appears in 2 out of 19 modifications (10.53% confidence).\n\nOther entities like `MainWindow`, `EditorSpellChecking`, `EditorTextArea`, etc., also show varying levels of co-change relationships but have lower confidence compared to the top few.\n\n### Recommendation\nWe should prioritize synchronizing changes for entities with higher confidence scores, starting with `EditorController`, as it has the strongest correlation with changes to `IEditor.java`. To better understand the nature of these dependencies, we can now use additional tools like `get_coupling_dependencies` or `get_call_graph` to examine structural dependencies involving `IEditor.java` and these co-changing entities.\n\nWould you like to analyze coupling dependencies between `IEditor.java` and one of these co-changing entities, such as `EditorController`?",

Below is a summary of the results, highlighting the most significant entities based on confidence:\n\n1. **`EditorController`**: Appears in 17 out of 19 modifications of `IEditor.java`, resulting in an 89.47% confidence level. This suggests a strong dependency between these two entities.\n2. **`GlossaryTextAreaTest`**: Appears in 13 out of 19 modifications (68.42% confidence).\n3. **`MainWindowMenuHandler`**: Modified alongside `IEditor.java` 13 times with 68.42% confidence.\n4. **`SearchWindowTest`**: Appears in 4 out of 19 modifications (21.05% confidence).\n5. **`RealProject` and `SegmentBuilder`**: Each appears in 2 out of 19 modifications (10.53% confidence).\n\nOther entities like `MainWindow`, `EditorSpellChecking`, `EditorTextArea`, etc., also show varying levels of co-change relationships but have lower confidence compared to the top few.\n\n### Recommendation\nWe should prioritize synchronizing changes for entities with higher confidence scores, starting with `EditorController`, as it has the strongest correlation with changes to `IEditor.java`. To better understand the nature of these dependencies, we can now use additional tools like `get_coupling_dependencies` or `get_call_graph` to examine structural dependencies involving `IEditor.java` and these co-changing entities.\n\nWould you like to analyze coupling dependencies between `IEditor.java` and one of these co-changing entities, such as `EditorController`?",

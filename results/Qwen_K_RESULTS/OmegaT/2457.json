To determine which entities need synchronization, we should focus on those with high confidence (e.g., confidence of 0.5 or higher) since they represent strong historical correlation.\n\n### Observations:\n1. **High Confidence Entities (>= 0.5):**\n   - `RealProject` has a confidence of 1.0, indicating it is consistently modified alongside `IProject.java`. This is a critical candidate for synchronization.\n   - `NotLoadedProject` has a confidence of 0.9, indicating a very strong relationship as well.\n\n2. **Moderate Confidence Entities (between 0.2 and 0.5):**\n   - `EditorController` (0.35), `ProjectUICommands` (0.3), `LoadFilesCallback` (0.25), `FindMatchesThread` (0.25), `Statistics` (0.2), and others in this range indicate moderate but significant coupling.\n\n3. **Low Confidence Entities (< 0.2):**\n   - These include many test files and utility classes with low co-change frequency. While potentially related, their low confidence suggests weaker direct dependency.\n\n### Next Steps:\nTo further refine the impact analysis, I will examine the coupling dependencies between `IProject.java` and key candidates like `RealProject.java` and `NotLoadedProject.java`. This will help identify whether there are strong structural dependencies reinforcing these co-change relationships.\n\nLet\u2019s begin by analyzing the coupling dependencies between `IProject.java` and `RealProject.java`.\n\n",

This confirms that changes in `IProject` (e.g., method signatures, added or removed methods) will likely affect `RealProject`.\n\nGiven this strong dependency, `RealProject.java` must be synchronized whenever `IProject.java` changes.\n\n### Next Step:\nLet\u2019s similarly analyze the coupling dependencies between `IProject.java` and `NotLoadedProject.java` to determine whether their high co-change confidence (0.9) is backed by a structural dependency.\n",

To determine which entities need synchronization, we should focus on those with high confidence (e.g., confidence of 0.5 or higher) since they represent strong historical correlation.\n\n### Observations:\n1. **High Confidence Entities (>= 0.5):**\n   - `RealProject` has a confidence of 1.0, indicating it is consistently modified alongside `IProject.java`. This is a critical candidate for synchronization.\n   - `NotLoadedProject` has a confidence of 0.9, indicating a very strong relationship as well.\n\n2. **Moderate Confidence Entities (between 0.2 and 0.5):**\n   - `EditorController` (0.35), `ProjectUICommands` (0.3), `LoadFilesCallback` (0.25), `FindMatchesThread` (0.25), `Statistics` (0.2), and others in this range indicate moderate but significant coupling.\n\n3. **Low Confidence Entities (< 0.2):**\n   - These include many test files and utility classes with low co-change frequency. While potentially related, their low confidence suggests weaker direct dependency.\n\n### Next Steps:\nTo further refine the impact analysis, I will examine the coupling dependencies between `IProject.java` and key candidates like `RealProject.java` and `NotLoadedProject.java`. This will help identify whether there are strong structural dependencies reinforcing these co-change relationships.\n\nLet\u2019s begin by analyzing the coupling dependencies between `IProject.java` and `RealProject.java`.\n\n",

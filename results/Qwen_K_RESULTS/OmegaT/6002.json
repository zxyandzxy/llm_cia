Notably:\n\n- `EditorController` has a high confidence score of ~0.895, indicating that whenever `IEditor.java` was modified, `EditorController` was also involved in most cases (17 out of 19 times).\n- `MainWindowMenuHandler` also shows strong co-change behavior with ~0.684 confidence.\n- `GlossaryTextAreaTest` and `SearchWindowTest` show moderate co-change tendencies with a confidence of ~0.684 and ~0.21 respectively.\n\nBased on these results, here is the breakdown of potentially important files for synchronization consideration:\n\n### High Priority\n- **EditorController** (`confidence: ~0.895`) - Strong historical correlation; likely critical to synchronize changes with `IEditor.java`.\n\n### Medium Priority\n- **MainWindowMenuHandler** (`confidence: ~0.684`) - Frequent co-change indicates some level of dependency.\n- **GlossaryTextAreaTest** (`confidence: ~0.684`) - May indicate shared logic or test coverage related to `IEditor.java`.\n\n### Low Priority (but notable)\n- **MainWindow** (`confidence: ~0.21`)\n- **MainWindowMenu** (`confidence: ~0.421`)\n- **SearchWindowTest** (`confidence: ~0.21`)\n\nThe rest of the files have much lower confidence scores and may not require immediate synchronization unless specific contextual dependencies are identified.\n\nTo proceed further, I will analyze the coupling relationships between `IEditor.java` and its strongest co-changed counterpart, `EditorController`, using the `get_coupling_dependencies` function. This will help determine if there are direct code-level dependencies justifying the high co-change correlation. \n\nLet me make the function call:\n",

This kind of inheritance or interface implementation often means that changes in the interface (`IEditor.java`) directly impact the implementing class (`EditorController`), making synchronization essential.\n\n### Conclusion on Synchronization Needs\n\n- \u2705 **EditorController must be synchronized** whenever `IEditor.java` changes, due to its direct implementation dependency.\n- The co-change history further reinforces this necessity, showing that developers have historically modified both files together in most cases.\n\n### Next Steps\nIf you'd like to explore other dependencies (e.g., indirect couplings, semantic similarity, or call graph relationships), I can proceed with additional analyses.

Notably:\n\n- `EditorController` has a high confidence score of ~0.895, indicating that whenever `IEditor.java` was modified, `EditorController` was also involved in most cases (17 out of 19 times).\n- `MainWindowMenuHandler` also shows strong co-change behavior with ~0.684 confidence.\n- `GlossaryTextAreaTest` and `SearchWindowTest` show moderate co-change tendencies with a confidence of ~0.684 and ~0.21 respectively.\n\nBased on these results, here is the breakdown of potentially important files for synchronization consideration:\n\n### High Priority\n- **EditorController** (`confidence: ~0.895`) - Strong historical correlation; likely critical to synchronize changes with `IEditor.java`.\n\n### Medium Priority\n- **MainWindowMenuHandler** (`confidence: ~0.684`) - Frequent co-change indicates some level of dependency.\n- **GlossaryTextAreaTest** (`confidence: ~0.684`) - May indicate shared logic or test coverage related to `IEditor.java`.\n\n### Low Priority (but notable)\n- **MainWindow** (`confidence: ~0.21`)\n- **MainWindowMenu** (`confidence: ~0.421`)\n- **SearchWindowTest** (`confidence: ~0.21`)\n\nThe rest of the files have much lower confidence scores and may not require immediate synchronization unless specific contextual dependencies are identified.\n\nTo proceed further, I will analyze the coupling relationships between `IEditor.java` and its strongest co-changed counterpart, `EditorController`, using the `get_coupling_dependencies` function. This will help determine if there are direct code-level dependencies justifying the high co-change correlation. \n\nLet me make the function call:\n",

This kind of inheritance or interface implementation often means that changes in the interface (`IEditor.java`) directly impact the implementing class (`EditorController`), making synchronization essential.\n\n### Conclusion on Synchronization Needs\n\n- \u2705 **EditorController must be synchronized** whenever `IEditor.java` changes, due to its direct implementation dependency.\n- The co-change history further reinforces this necessity, showing that developers have historically modified both files together in most cases.\n\n### Next Steps\nIf you'd like to explore other dependencies (e.g., indirect couplings, semantic similarity, or call graph relationships), I can proceed with additional analyses.

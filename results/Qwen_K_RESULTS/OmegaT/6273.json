Please note that in order to ensure recall, you need to give as many entities as possible (preferably more than 40) that need to be modified synchronously based on your analysis, where the result of the function get_co_change_relationship should be used as an important reference. An example of the answer is given below:Title: Diagnosis of starting entity `DatabaseURL`Change set: [ServerConstants, jdbcDriver]Details: Explain why each entity in your given change set needs to synchronize changes"

Though no direct coupling dependencies were found between `AutoCompleter.java` and `AutoCompleterListView`, a high conceptual coupling score of 0.859 suggests semantic similarity, justifying their inclusion in the change set. Other entities such as `TagAutoCompleterView`, `CharTableAutoCompleterView`, and `AbstractAutoCompleterView` also exhibit moderate to high co-change confidence and likely share contextual or functional ties. Entities like `AutoCompleterItem`, `EditorController`, and menu-related classes appear less frequently in co-changes but still warrant inclusion due to potential indirect interactions or shared control flows. Including all these files ensures comprehensive coverage and improves recall for synchronizing modifications effectively.",

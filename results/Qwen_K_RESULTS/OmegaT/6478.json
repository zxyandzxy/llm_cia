These could be edge cases where specific features tied to the editor may require synchronization under certain conditions.  \n- Test-related entities like **GlossaryAutoCompleterViewTest** and **FalseFriendsTest**: May share fixtures or mock objects related to `IEditor.java`.  \n- UI/controller components such as **ConflictDialog**, **InsertTagsPopup**, **MultipleTransPane**, etc.: Suggests that user interaction aspects tied to the editor might also need updates.  \n\nAll these entities are included based on the co-change history to maximize recall, ensuring no potentially dependent component is overlooked when modifying `IEditor.java`.",

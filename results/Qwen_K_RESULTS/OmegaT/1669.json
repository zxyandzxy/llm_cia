Likely to be tightly coupled in functionality.  \n- **MainWindowMenuHandler**: High support (13) and confidence (~0.684), suggesting frequent joint modifications, possibly due to shared UI or event handling logic.  \n- **GlossaryTextAreaTest**: Also high support (13) and confidence (~0.684), likely due to shared test scenarios or dependencies on editor behavior.  \n- **MainWindowMenu**: Moderate confidence (~0.421) and support (8), may be involved in menu-related interactions tied to the editor.  \n- **SearchWindowTest**: Support (4), moderate confidence (~0.21). May share similar testing infrastructure or helper methods with `IEditor.java`.  \n- **MainWindow**: Support (4), confidence (~0.21). Could be linked through general UI initialization or lifecycle management.  \n- **RealProject**: Support (2), confidence (~0.105). May interact with editor state during project operations.  \n- **SegmentBuilder**: Support (2), confidence (~0.105). Possibly used for building segments edited in the editor.  \n- **EditorTextArea**: Support (2), confidence (~0.105). Likely contains text editing components used by the editor.  \n- **StaticUtils**: Support (2), confidence (~0.105). General utility class that both entities may rely on.  \n- **MatchesTextArea**: Support (2), confidence (~0.105). May display matches related to the current editor content.  \n- **AutoCompleter**, **GlossaryAutoCompleterView**, **AutoCompleterView**, **MultipleTransPane**, **EditorSpellChecking**, **EditorSettings**, **MarkerController**, **ChangeUserDictionary**, **TMXEntry**, **TagValidationFrame**, **TagValidationTool**, **ITagValidation**, **HListener**, **TagComparator**, **EditorTextArea3**, **Language**, **EmptyNoneTranslationPopup**, **ForceCommitTimer**, **CaretPosition**, **ReplaceFilter**, **DisplayedEntryImpl**, **IProject**, **ConflictDialog**, **NotLoadedProject**, **FalseFriendsTest**, **OptimisticLockingFail**, **AllTranslations**, **ConflictDialogController**, **EditorUtils**, **EntryMarks**, **DocumentFilter3**, **InsertTagsPopup**, **GlossaryAutoCompleterViewTest**, **Main**, **ErrorReport**: Each has low support (1) and confidence (~0.0526). However, to ensure recall and avoid missing potential impacts, they are included as they have appeared in co-change history at least once. These could represent infrequent but real dependencies.\n\nThese entities should be considered for synchronized modification based on their historical co-change patterns with `IEditor.java`, ensuring comprehensive coverage of potential ripple effects.",

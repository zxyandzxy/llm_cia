The entities with higher confidence scores indicate stronger relationships and should be prioritized for synchronization consideration. \n\nHere's a breakdown of what to do next:\n\n1. **High Confidence Entities (Confidence >= 0.5):**\n   - `MainWindowMenuHandler` (confidence: ~0.684)\n   - `EditorController` (confidence: ~0.895)\n   - `GlossaryTextAreaTest` (confidence: ~0.684)\n\n   These files demonstrate strong historical co-change patterns with `IEditor.java`. You should investigate these further using other functions like `get_coupling_dependencies` or `get_conceptual_coupling` to determine if there is also structural or semantic coupling.\n\n2. **Medium Confidence Entities (0.1 < Confidence < 0.5):**\n   - Examples include `MainWindow` (~0.21), `EditorTextArea` (~0.105), `RealProject` (~0.105), etc.\n   \n   These files show moderate historical correlation but might not require immediate synchronization unless additional evidence of dependency is found.\n\n3. **Low Confidence Entities (Confidence <= 0.1):**\n   - Many files fall into this category, such as `ChangeUserDictionary` (~0.0526), `TMXEntry` (~0.0526), etc.\n   \n   These files likely have minimal direct impact, although they may occasionally be changed alongside `IEditor.java`.\n\n### Next Steps:\nLet\u2019s analyze one of the high-confidence entities in more depth. I'll start with `EditorController`, since it has the highest confidence score (~0.895), to see if there is also coupling between `IEditor.java` and `EditorController.java`.\n\n",

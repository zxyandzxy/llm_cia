Although there are no direct code dependencies, the high semantic similarity suggests that these entities are functionally related and should be considered for synchronized changes to maintain consistency in the system.\n\n**Recommended Entities to Synchronize:**\n- `MainWindowMenu.java`\n- `ProjectUICommands.java`",

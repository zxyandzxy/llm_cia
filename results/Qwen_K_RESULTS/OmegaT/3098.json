Based on the results, we can identify which entities are most likely impacted by changes in `SegmentBuilder.java`.\n\n### Analysis of Co-Change Results:\n\n1. **High Confidence Relationships (> 0.3 confidence)**:\n   - `EditorController` (7 modifications, confidence: 0.5)\n   - `CalcMarkersThread` (5 modifications, confidence: 0.357)\n   - `MarkerController` (5 modifications, confidence: 0.357)\n\n   These entities have relatively high confidence scores, indicating a strong historical correlation between their modifications and changes to `SegmentBuilder.java`. These should be considered as top priorities for synchronization.\n\n2. **Medium Confidence Relationships (0.1\u20130.3 confidence)**:\n   - `IMarker`, `TransTips`, `EditorUtils`, `Styles`, `RealProject`, `EditorSettings`, `EditorTextArea3`\n   - These have moderate confidence values and may require further investigation depending on the nature of the change in `SegmentBuilder.java`.\n\n3. **Low Confidence Relationships (< 0.1 confidence)**:\n   - Entities like `WaveUnderline`, `TransTipsMarker`, `SpellCheckerMarker`, `MatchesTextArea`, `EntryListPane`, etc.\n   - These were co-changed only once or twice with `SegmentBuilder.java`, and thus are less likely to be significantly impacted.\n\n### Next Steps:\n\nTo further refine our analysis, we can focus on one or more of the following actions:\n\n1. Analyze dependencies between `SegmentBuilder.java` and the high-confidence co-change entities (`EditorController`, `CalcMarkersThread`, `MarkerController`) using `get_coupling_dependencies`.\n2.

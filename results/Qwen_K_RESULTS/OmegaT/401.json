These are commonly involved in collaborative changes within complex systems like OmegaT.  \n- The co-change data serves as a strong indicator of historical change patterns, and combined with general system architecture knowledge, we expanded the list to include other relevant components that are likely to be affected by changes in filter-related logic.  \n- Conceptual coupling analysis supports semantic alignment with several of these entities, even in the absence of direct code dependencies.  \n- To ensure high recall, we have included entities that may interact indirectly with the filter subsystem, such as those managing configurations, parsing content, or coordinating user interface updates.",

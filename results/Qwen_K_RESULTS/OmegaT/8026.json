Since it has a moderate confidence score, changes in `Main.java` might often require updates here.\n\n2. **IProject (Support: 1, Confidence: 0.5)**  \n   Being an interface, this likely defines methods implemented by classes like `RealProject`. Changes in `Main.java` could affect how these interfaces are used or implemented elsewhere.\n\n3. **NotLoadedProject (Support: 1, Confidence: 0.5)**  \n   This could represent a placeholder or stub for projects that are not yet loaded into the system. If `Main.java` deals with project loading logic, this may need updates.\n\n4. **ProjectUICommands (Support: 1, Confidence: 0.5)**  \n   This class likely handles UI commands related to projects. If `Main.java` involves user interactions or command handling, synchronizing changes here might be necessary.\n\n5. **Styles (Support: 1, Confidence: 0.5)**  \n   This entity is possibly responsible for styling or visual representation within the application. Synchronization might be needed if `Main.java` impacts UI appearance.\n\n6. **EditorTextArea3 (Support: 1, Confidence: 0.5)**  \n   Likely represents a component for text editing in the UI.

                "content": "The co-change relationships for `LuceneEnglishTokenizer.java` have been retrieved. Here\u2019s a breakdown of the results:\n\n### Co-Change Analysis Results:\n1. **Co-Changed Entities**: The file `LuceneEnglishTokenizer.java` has co-changed with several other tokenizer implementations (e.g., `LuceneBulgarianTokenizer`, `LuceneHungarianTokenizer`, etc.), alongside files like `BaseTokenizer` and `TokenizerTest`.\n2. **Support and Confidence**:\n   - For all listed entities, the number of supports is `1`, and the confidence level is `0.5` (or 50%).\n   - This means that during one modification of `LuceneEnglishTokenizer.java`, these files were also modified once in that same context.\n\n### Interpretation:\n- Since all co-changed files show similar support and confidence levels, there might be general parity or parallel development happening across different language-specific tokenizers within this component of the project.\n- Notably, `BaseTokenizer` likely serves as a foundational class, so its relationship with `LuceneEnglishTokenizer` could be particularly significant.\n- `TokenizerTest` being co-changed suggests testing logic may also need synchronization when changes are made to specific tokenizers.\n\n### Next Steps:\nTo determine which entities truly require synchronization, further investigation into their dependencies and conceptual coupling with `LuceneEnglishTokenizer.java` will help prioritize them. Let's proceed by analyzing coupling dependencies for `LuceneEnglishTokenizer.java` and `BaseTokenizer.java`, since the latter appears conceptually important.\n\nI'll call the `get_coupling_dependencies` function for these two files. \n\n",

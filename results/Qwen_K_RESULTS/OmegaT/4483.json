In order to help solve the CIA mission, you should first understand some necessary concepts\uff1a\n(1)entity: Entities represent source code files in CIA tasks, and all the CIA tasks under study are based on the Java language, so entities are files with the .java extension.\n(2)starting entity: The starting entity is also called salient entity, and the salient entity is the root change that causes the modification of the rest of entities in a change set, while the rest of entities are the dependency modification along with the salient one.\nYou will be presented with a starting entity and tools (functions) will be provided to access the more information of the origin system. Your task is to gradually explain which entity really need to be synchronized, based on the starting entity and the information obtained through the function-call. You have 7 chances to call the function to get more information."

Please note that in order to ensure recall, you need to give as many entities as possible (preferably more than 40) that need to be modified synchronously based on your analysis, where the result of the function get_co_change_relationship should be used as an important reference. An example of the answer is given below:Title: Diagnosis of starting entity `DatabaseURL`Change set: [ServerConstants, jdbcDriver]Details: Explain why each entity in your given change set needs to synchronize changes"

Since `OConsts.java` contains global constants used across the system (file paths, extensions, UI defaults, etc.), changes may implicitly affect components that rely on these values.  \n\n- **StaticUtils**: Highest support and confidence; likely uses file/path-related constants.\n- **MainWindowMenuHandler**, **MainWindowMenu**, **LicenseDialog**, **HelpFrame**, **FontSelectionDialog**, **ProjectProperties**, **ProjectPropertiesDialog**, **NewProjectDialog**, **ProjectFrame**, **LastChangesDialog**, **MatchingSimilarityDialog**, **MDialogThread**, **MatchWindow**, **TransFrame**: GUI/dialog components that may use UI or file-related constants.\n- **CommandThread**, **EditorController**, **EditorTextArea**, **SegmentBuilder**, **Token**, **StringEntry**: Involved in editing and text processing; may depend on formatting or segmentation constants.\n- **RealProject**, **ProjectFileStorage**, **FileUtil**, **TMXReader2**: File/project handling modules that may use path, extension, or I/O constants.\n- **Preferences**, **OStrings**: Configuration and localization utilities that may share constant usage for settings or UI strings.\n- **NearString**, **ProjectFileStorage**, **StatsFilename-related classes**: May refer to file naming or storage constants defined in `OConsts.java`.\n- **Main**, **Command-line related classes**: Likely access constants such as application name, version, or debug paths.\n\nDue to the pervasive use of constants throughout the codebase, even without direct structural dependencies, any modification in `OConsts.java` can ripple through these files.",

However, further analysis using coupling dependencies revealed that **none of these entities have any direct code-level relationship with `Styles.java`**.\n\nThis suggests that the co-changes may have been coincidental or due to broader refactorings rather than actual interdependencies.\n\n### Next Steps:\nIf you would like to explore whether there's any **indirect dependency** or **conceptual coupling** (semantic similarity) between `Styles.java` and any of these entities, we can proceed by using the `get_conceptual_coupling` function for semantic analysis.\n\nWould you like to continue with conceptual coupling analysis between `Styles.java` and any of these entities?",

This confirms that there is no direct code-level relationship between these two entities.\n\n### Summary of Analysis:\n\nThe co-change relationships for `Styles.java` showed that four entities (`MatchesTextArea`, `ReplaceFilter`, `ComesFromTMMarker`, and `GlossaryTextAreaTest`) had been historically modified together once each with 50% confidence. However, further analysis using coupling dependencies revealed that **none of these entities have any direct code-level relationship with `Styles.java`**.\n\nThis suggests that the co-changes may have been coincidental or due to broader refactorings rather than actual interdependencies.\n\n### Next Steps:\nIf you would like to explore whether there's any **indirect dependency** or **conceptual coupling** (semantic similarity) between `Styles.java` and any of these entities, we can proceed by using the `get_conceptual_coupling` function for semantic analysis.\n\nWould you like to continue with conceptual coupling analysis between `Styles.java` and any of these entities?",

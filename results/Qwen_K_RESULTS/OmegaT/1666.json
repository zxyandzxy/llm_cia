Likely a core collaborator.  \n- **MainWindowMenuHandler**: High confidence (0.6842), often changed together; possibly involved in menu-driven editor actions.  \n- **GlossaryTextAreaTest**: Also high confidence (0.6842), suggests shared test logic or implementation coupling.  \n- **MainWindowMenu**: Moderate confidence (0.4211), often related to UI components tied to editor functionality.  \n- **SearchWindowTest**: Medium confidence (0.2105), indicates possible integration with search features.  \n- **RealProject**: Medium support count and confidence (0.1053), may interact with project management during editing.  \n- **SegmentBuilder**: Medium support (0.1053), likely involved in text segmentation used by the editor.  \n- **MainWindow**: Medium confidence (0.2105), central UI component that hosts the editor.  \n- **EditorTextArea**: Medium confidence (0.1053), could be a UI component directly linked to the editor interface.  \n- **StaticUtils**: Medium confidence (0.1053), utility functions used across editor-related classes.  \n- **MatchesTextArea**: Medium confidence (0.1053), potentially used for displaying matches within the editor context.  \n- **GlossaryAutoCompleterViewTest**: Low confidence but repeated co-change (support = 1), possibly part of testing infrastructure.  \n- **ConflictDialogController**: Low confidence (0.0526), but may handle UI interactions triggered by the editor.  \n- **EditorUtils**: Low confidence (0.0526), general utility class used across editor modules.  \n- **EntryMarks**: Low confidence (0.0526), possibly handles markups or annotations within the editor.  \n- **DocumentFilter3**: Low confidence (0.0526), might filter or process document content in the editor.  \n- **InsertTagsPopup**: Low confidence (0.0526), potentially inserts tags into the editor.  \n- **AutoCompleterView**: Low confidence (0.0526), provides auto-complete UI for the editor.  \n- **AutoCompleter**: Low confidence (0.0526), supports auto-complete features in the editor.  \n- **GlossaryAutoCompleterView**: Low confidence (0.0526), specific auto-complete feature for glossaries.  \n- **EmptyNoneTranslationPopup**: Low confidence (0.0526), possibly shows popups in translation scenarios.  \n- **MultipleTransPane**: Low confidence (0.0526), might display multiple translations in the editor UI.  \n- **ForceCommitTimer**: Low confidence (0.0526), possibly auto-saves or commits edits periodically.  \n- **CaretPosition**: Low confidence (0.0526), tracks cursor position in the editor.  \n- **ReplaceFilter**: Low confidence (0.0526), filters replacement operations in the editor.  \n- **DisplayedEntryImpl**: Low confidence (0.0526), represents displayed entries in the editor.  \n- **IProject**: Low confidence (0.0526), possibly interfaces with project data during editing.  \n- **ConflictDialog**: Low confidence (0.0526), handles conflict resolution during editing.  \n- **NotLoadedProject**: Low confidence (0.0526), may manage state when projects are not loaded.  \n- **FalseFriendsTest**: Low confidence (0.0526), may test false friend detection in translations.  \n- **OptimisticLockingFail**: Low confidence (0.0526), handles concurrency conflicts in editing.  \n- **AllTranslations**: Low confidence (0.0526), displays all translations, possibly integrated with editor.  \n- **Language**: Low confidence (0.0526), possibly handles language-specific settings in the editor.  \n- **EditorTextArea3**: Low confidence (0.0526), another UI element related to text input.  \n- **TagComparator**: Low confidence (0.0526), compares tags, potentially used during tag handling in the editor.  \n- **HListener**: Low confidence (0.0526), event listener for editor-related events.  \n- **ITagValidation**: Low confidence (0.0526), validates tags used in the editor.  \n- **ErrorReport**: Low confidence (0.0526), reports errors from the editor.  \n- **Main**: Low confidence (0.0526), possibly bootstraps the application that includes the editor.  \n- **TagValidationTool**: Low confidence (0.0526), performs validation of tags used in the editor.  \n- **TagValidationFrame**: Low confidence (0.0526), UI frame for tag validation.",

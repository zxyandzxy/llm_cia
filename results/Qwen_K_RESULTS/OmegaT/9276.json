Additionally, conceptual coupling analysis shows a high similarity score (~79.5%), suggesting close semantic alignment. While not an implementation dependency like `SpellChecker`, it plays a key functional role in the spell-checking process.\n\n- **SpellCheckerMarker**: Although its co-change confidence is only 50% (support = 1), it still appears in the historical synchronization pattern with `ISpellChecker.java`.

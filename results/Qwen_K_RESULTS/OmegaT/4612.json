Therefore, any changes in `FilterVisitor.java` might significantly impact `HTMLOptions.java`, and synchronization should prioritize this entity.\n\nWould you like to proceed with analyzing the conceptual coupling (semantic similarity) or examining the call graph for further insights?",

The `FilterVisitor` class uses an instance of the `HTMLOptions` class (specifically, a member variable named `options`) to invoke several methods in multiple locations within the code. These method calls include:\n\n- `getTranslateHref`\n- `getTranslateHreflang`\n- `getTranslateLang`\n- `getTranslateSrc`\n- `getTranslateValue`\n- `getTranslateButtonValue`\n- `getRemoveComments`\n- `getParagraphOnBr`\n- `getCompressWhitespace`\n\nThese interactions suggest that `HTMLOptions` plays a significant role in controlling the behavior of `FilterVisitor`, particularly through its configuration options.\n\nNext, let's analyze the coupling dependencies between `FilterVisitor.java` and `PatternConsts.java` to determine how tightly coupled they are.\n",

This indicates that the co-change relationship between these entities may be driven by factors other than direct code-level dependencies, such as shared functionality or developer behavior rather than explicit structural links.\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n\n- **Co-changed Entities:**\n  - `HTMLOptions.java` \u2013 **Strong coupling dependency found**, with multiple method invocations from `FilterVisitor`.\n  - `PatternConsts.java` \u2013 **No coupling dependency found**.\n  - `EditOptionsDialog.java` \u2013 **No coupling dependency found**.\n\n- **Conclusion:**\n  Among the co-changed entities, only `HTMLOptions.java` has a direct structural dependency on `FilterVisitor.java`. Therefore, any changes in `FilterVisitor.java` might significantly impact `HTMLOptions.java`, and synchronization should prioritize this entity.\n\nWould you like to proceed with analyzing the conceptual coupling (semantic similarity) or examining the call graph for further insights?",

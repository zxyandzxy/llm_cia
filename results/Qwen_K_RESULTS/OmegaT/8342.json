Please note that in order to ensure recall, you need to give as many entities as possible (preferably more than 40) that need to be modified synchronously based on your analysis, where the result of the function get_co_change_relationship should be used as an important reference. An example of the answer is given below:Title: Diagnosis of starting entity `DatabaseURL`Change set: [ServerConstants, jdbcDriver]Details: Explain why each entity in your given change set needs to synchronize changes"

Other co-changed entities (`TMXReader`, `Main`, `HelpFrame`, etc.) are included based on their historical modification patterns with `Language.java`, even if direct dependencies are not confirmed, to ensure high recall in the change impact analysis. Call graph entities such as `Core`, `Preferences`, and `Log` are also included for further investigation and completeness.",

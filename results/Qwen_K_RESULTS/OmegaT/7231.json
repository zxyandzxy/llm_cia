In order to help solve the CIA mission, you should first understand some necessary concepts\uff1a\n(1)entity: Entities represent source code files in CIA tasks, and all the CIA tasks under study are based on the Java language, so entities are files with the .java extension.\n(2)starting entity: The starting entity is also called salient entity, and the salient entity is the root change that causes the modification of the rest of entities in a change set, while the rest of entities are the dependency modification along with the salient one.\nYou will be presented with a starting entity and tools (functions) will be provided to access the more information of the origin system. Your task is to gradually explain which entity really need to be synchronized, based on the starting entity and the information obtained through the function-call. You have 7 chances to call the function to get more information."

It appeared as a co-changed file with support 2 and confidence 0.5, suggesting frequent synchronized modifications.  \n- **FilterBarSearch.java**: No structural coupling found, but it was identified as co-changed with `DockingUI.java` with support 1 and confidence 0.25. The conceptual coupling score is 0.8581, suggesting shared semantic context that may necessitate synchronized changes.  \n- **FilterBarReplace.java**: Also shows no direct coupling dependencies, but appears as a co-changed file with support 1 and confidence 0.25. Its functional similarity to `FilterBarSearch.java` and relationship to UI filtering suggests potential ripple effects from changes in `DockingUI.java`.  \n- **DockableScrollPane.java**: No coupling dependencies were found, yet it appears as a co-changed file with support 1 and confidence 0.25. Given its name and likely role in UI layout/container management alongside docking components, it may still be affected by changes in `DockingUI.java`.  \n\nDue to limited function call depth and data availability, only these four entities are directly supported by co-change relationships and conceptual coupling analysis.

Your task is to gradually explain which entity really need to be synchronized, based on the starting entity and the information obtained through the function-call.

Although there are no direct code dependencies, the strong historical and semantic relationships indicate that these files are functionally related and may need to evolve together to maintain system consistency.",

This further supports the co-change relationship observed earlier and suggests that `Main.java` likely interacts with or depends on the functionality of `TMXWriter.java` in a meaningful way.\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n\n- **Co-change Relationships:**\n  - `RealProject.java` and `Main.java` were both modified alongside `TMXWriter.java` with full confidence (1.0).\n  \n- **Coupling Dependencies:**\n  - No direct code-level coupling was found between `TMXWriter.java` and either `RealProject.java` or `Main.java`.\n\n- **Conceptual Coupling:**\n  - High semantic similarity was found:\n    - `TMXWriter.java` and `RealProject.java`: **0.839**\n    - `TMXWriter.java` and `Main.java`: **0.822**\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nBased on the combined results of co-change history and conceptual coupling, **both `RealProject.java` and `Main.java` should be considered for synchronization** whenever changes are made to `TMXWriter.java`. Although there are no direct code dependencies, the strong historical and semantic relationships indicate that these files are functionally related and may need to evolve together to maintain system consistency.",

It also shows high conceptual coupling (0.822), suggesting that it likely orchestrates or interacts with TMX writing functionality, possibly as part of application-wide behavior or core control flow.\n\nAlthough no further entities were returned by the `get_co_change_relationship` function, additional candidates for synchrony could not be reliably inferred within the constraints of this analysis round.

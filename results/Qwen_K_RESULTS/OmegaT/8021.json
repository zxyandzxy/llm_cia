Please note that in order to ensure recall, you need to give as many entities as possible (preferably more than 40) that need to be modified synchronously based on your analysis, where the result of the function get_co_change_relationship should be used as an important reference. An example of the answer is given below:Title: Diagnosis of starting entity `DatabaseURL`Change set: [ServerConstants, jdbcDriver]Details: Explain why each entity in your given change set needs to synchronize changes"

Other files like `ScriptItem`, `IScriptLogger`, `Main`, etc., also show weaker but notable co-change relationships. Additionally, conceptual coupling between `ScriptingWindow.java` and `ScriptsMonitor` is high (0.838), reinforcing their connection. The call graph reveals direct dependencies on utility and core classes such as `OmegaTIcons`, `StaticUIUtils`, `Core`, `Preferences`, etc., which are likely involved in similar functional contexts. These entities collectively form a change set that should be considered for synchronized modification to ensure consistency and prevent regression issues.",

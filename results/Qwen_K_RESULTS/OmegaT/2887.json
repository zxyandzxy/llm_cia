In order to help solve the CIA mission, you should first understand some necessary concepts\uff1a\n(1)entity: Entities represent source code files in CIA tasks, and all the CIA tasks under study are based on the Java language, so entities are files with the .java extension.\n(2)starting entity: The starting entity is also called salient entity, and the salient entity is the root change that causes the modification of the rest of entities in a change set, while the rest of entities are the dependency modification along with the salient one.\nYou will be presented with a starting entity and tools (functions) will be provided to access the more information of the origin system. Your task is to gradually explain which entity really need to be synchronized, based on the starting entity and the information obtained through the function-call. You have 7 chances to call the function to get more information."

Here are the key details:\n\n### Coupling Details:\n- **Type of Coupling:** ConstructorInvoking (CMAIM)\n- **Location:** Multiple methods in `EditorController.java`, including:\n  - `onProjectChanged`\n  - `loadDocument`\n  - `activateEntry`\n  - `onTextChanged`\n  - `commitAndDeactivate`\n  - `remarkOneMarker`\n  - `markActiveEntrySource`\n- **Specific Interactions:**\n  - The `markerController` member variable (an instance of `MarkerController`) is used to invoke several methods such as:\n    - `reset`\n    - `process`\n    - `resetEntryMarks`\n    - `getMarkerIndex`\n    - `setEntryMarks`\n\n### Analysis:\nThis coupling indicates that `EditorController.java` actively uses `MarkerController.java` to manage marker-related functionality, especially during document loading, text changes, entry activation/deactivation, and project change events.\n\nSince there is strong historical co-change correlation (**confidence: ~16.7%**) and **direct method invocations** from `EditorController` to `MarkerController`, it confirms that **`MarkerController.java` should be synchronized** when changes are made to `EditorController.java`.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Entities That Need Synchronization with `EditorController.java`:\n| Entity | Co-Change Confidence | Coupling Dependency | Recommendation |\n|--------|----------------------|---------------------|----------------|\n| `SegmentBuilder.java` | ~22.2% | \u2705 Yes (MMAUA) | \u2705 Should synchronize |\n| `EditorTextArea3.java` | ~27.8% | \u2705 Yes (CMAUA, CMAIA, CMAIM) | \u2705 Should synchronize |\n| `MarkerController.java` | ~16.7% | \u2705 Yes (CMAIM) | \u2705 Should synchronize |\n| `IEditor.java` | ~16.7% | \u274c No coupling found | \u26a0\ufe0f May be indirectly related; further analysis needed |\n\nWould you like me to perform additional analysis on any of these files or proceed with conceptual coupling checks for deeper insights?",

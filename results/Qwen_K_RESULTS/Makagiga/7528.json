In order to help solve the CIA mission, you should first understand some necessary concepts\uff1a\n(1)entity: Entities represent source code files in CIA tasks, and all the CIA tasks under study are based on the Java language, so entities are files with the .java extension.\n(2)starting entity: The starting entity is also called salient entity, and the salient entity is the root change that causes the modification of the rest of entities in a change set, while the rest of entities are the dependency modification along with the salient one.\nYou will be presented with a starting entity and tools (functions) will be provided to access the more information of the origin system. Your task is to gradually explain which entity really need to be synchronized, based on the starting entity and the information obtained through the function-call. You have 7 chances to call the function to get more information."

Strong co-change likelihood due to shared functionality.\n- **WidgetDesktopPaneUI**: Directly used by Desktop.java; likely impacted by changes in desktop behavior or layout logic.\n- **InternetSearchPanel**: Still present and historically co-changed with MActionInfo; likely shares similar feature context.\n- **Desktop**: Present in current version and had high co-change support with MActionInfo; core interaction point for many components.\n- **Config, FS, UI, TK, MLogger**: Common utility classes used by Desktop; often synchronized when core APIs change.\n- **StringProperty, ColorProperty**: Used within Desktop's UI system; may be affected by property handling changes.\n- **GHNSDialog, MApplication, MCalendarPanel, MMessage, LinkEditor, PropertyPanel, SearchBar, MInternalFrame, WidgetDesktopIconUI, HistoryDialog, IconTheme, HighlightAction, ImageEditor, Day, MDialog, MNotification**: These were co-changed with relatively higher confidence (>=0.0625); some may have been removed but still indicate historical coupling.\n- **Tabs, Dialog**: Had notable co-change confidence; though now removed, they suggest impact on UI/dialog-related components during their active phase.\n\nThis list includes all entities that showed significant historical co-change relationships and/or direct dependencies based on available information.

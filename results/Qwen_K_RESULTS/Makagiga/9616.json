Please note that in order to ensure recall, you need to give as many entities as possible (preferably more than 40) that need to be modified synchronously based on your analysis, where the result of the function get_co_change_relationship should be used as an important reference. An example of the answer is given below:Title: Diagnosis of starting entity `DatabaseURL`Change set: [ServerConstants, jdbcDriver]Details: Explain why each entity in your given change set needs to synchronize changes"

These entities may share functional dependencies, data structures, or event-handling logic. Entities with moderate confidence (e.g., MComboBox, PluginSettings) also show recurring co-changes and should be considered for synchronization to ensure consistency across the system. Even those with lower confidence were included to maximize recall, as in CIA tasks it is crucial to capture all potentially impacted components.",

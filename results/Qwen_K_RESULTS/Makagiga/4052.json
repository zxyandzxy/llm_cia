Entities like `SummaryPanel`, `Reminder`, `SummaryTree`, and `Action` show higher confidence values, suggesting a strong likelihood of needing synchronized changes. Lower-confidence entities are also included to ensure recall is prioritized, as per the request. These relationships may stem from direct or indirect dependencies, shared functionality, or conceptual coupling within the system.",

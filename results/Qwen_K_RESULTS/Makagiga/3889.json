Based on the confidence values, we can identify which entities are most frequently changed together with `Vars.java`. Entities with higher confidence (e.g., above 0.15) might be more likely to require synchronization when changes occur in `Vars.java`.\n\nHere are the entities with confidence greater than or equal to 0.18:\n\n- **MainWindow** (Support: 3, Confidence: ~0.2727)\n- **Tabs** (Support: 2, Confidence: ~0.1818)\n- **NewFolderDialog** (Support: 2, Confidence: ~0.1818)\n- **MetaInfo** (Support: 2, Confidence: ~0.1818)\n- **PropertiesPanel** (Support: 2, Confidence: ~0.1818)\n- **ImageEditorCore** (Support: 2, Confidence: ~0.1818)\n- **SummaryData** (Support: 2, Confidence: ~0.1818)\n- **SummaryPanel** (Support: 2, Confidence: ~0.1818)\n- **Console** (Support: 2, Confidence: ~0.1818)\n- **EnumProperty** (Support: 2, Confidence: ~0.1818)\n- **ChartModel** (Support: 2, Confidence: ~0.1818)\n\nEntities with a confidence value below 0.18 but still relevant for potential synchronization:\n- **Reminder**, **TaskComponent**, **TasksSettings**, **MFlipPanel**, etc., all have lower support and confidence values (~0.0909), meaning they were occasionally modified alongside `Vars.java`.\n\nTo proceed with further analysis, it would be useful to investigate the coupling dependencies between `Vars.java` and the top candidates for synchronization (e.g., `MainWindow`, `Tabs`, `PropertiesPanel`, etc.) to understand how these files interact at the code level.\n\nLet's start by analyzing the coupling dependencies between `Vars.java` and `MainWindow.java`, as it has the highest confidence among the co-change relationships.\n\nCall to action: I will now call the `get_coupling_dependencies` function to analyze the coupling between `Vars.java` and `MainWindow.java`.",

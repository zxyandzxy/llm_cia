In order to help solve the CIA mission, you should first understand some necessary concepts\uff1a\n(1)entity: Entities represent source code files in CIA tasks, and all the CIA tasks under study are based on the Java language, so entities are files with the .java extension.\n(2)starting entity: The starting entity is also called salient entity, and the salient entity is the root change that causes the modification of the rest of entities in a change set, while the rest of entities are the dependency modification along with the salient one.\nYou will be presented with a starting entity and tools (functions) will be provided to access the more information of the origin system. Your task is to gradually explain which entity really need to be synchronized, based on the starting entity and the information obtained through the function-call. You have 7 chances to call the function to get more information."

This further confirms that even though there are no direct coupling dependencies, these two entities share a significant amount of semantic overlap\u2014likely in terms of functionality or domain logic.\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n\n| Relationship Pair              | Co-Change Support | Co-Change Confidence | Coupling Dependencies | Conceptual Coupling |\n|-------------------------------|-------------------|----------------------|------------------------|---------------------|\n| `Tool.java` \u2192 `SelectionTool.java` | 8                 | 0.5714               | None                   | 0.8169              |\n| `Tool.java` \u2192 `ImageEditorCore.java` | 6                 | 0.4286               | None                   | 0.8207              |\n\n### Final Analysis:\nBoth `SelectionTool.java` and `ImageEditorCore.java` show:\n- Strong historical co-change patterns\n- No direct static code dependencies\n- Very high semantic similarity\n\nThis suggests that changes in `Tool.java` are likely to impact both of these files due to shared responsibilities and concepts, even if they don\u2019t interact directly through method calls or inheritance.\n\n### Recommended Synchronized Changes:\nBased on the CIA results, the following files should be considered for synchronized changes when modifying `Tool.java`:\n- \u2705 **SelectionTool.java** (high confidence and semantic similarity)\n- \u2705 **ImageEditorCore.java** (strong semantic link and call graph presence)\n\nWould you like me to retrieve the source code of any of these files for deeper inspection?",

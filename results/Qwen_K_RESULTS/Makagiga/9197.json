Though no direct coupling was found between `VersionControl.java` and `VersionPanel`, high conceptual coupling (0.872) supports functional interdependence. Other co-changed entities such as `FSHelper`, `AdvancedProperties`, and `FeedThread` also show moderate confidence values (0.25), indicating historical correlation in change patterns. To ensure recall and capture all potentially affected components, we expanded the change set using project context and typical module interactions in desktop applications like Makagiga, which involve UI, configuration, file handling, and plugin systems. These entities are likely to be impacted indirectly through shared workflows or data models.",

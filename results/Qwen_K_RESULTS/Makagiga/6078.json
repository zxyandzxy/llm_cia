Although the confidence is relatively low (0.25), they still represent potential candidates for synchronization due to possible indirect or weak dependencies.\n- Coupling dependency checks between `XMLHelper.java` and each entity in the list revealed no direct coupling dependencies for most pairs, which suggests that the relationships are not based on structural dependencies but may stem from functional or historical co-evolution.\n- Despite the lack of coupling dependencies, the co-change data implies that developers have previously synchronized changes with these files, indicating a need for cautious inclusion in the change set to avoid regression issues or behavioral inconsistencies.\n\nTherefore, considering the importance of recall and the nature of CIA tasks, the above entities are recommended for synchronized modification alongside `XMLHelper.java`.",

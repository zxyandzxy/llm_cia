In order to help solve the CIA mission, you should first understand some necessary concepts\uff1a\n(1)entity: Entities represent source code files in CIA tasks, and all the CIA tasks under study are based on the Java language, so entities are files with the .java extension.\n(2)starting entity: The starting entity is also called salient entity, and the salient entity is the root change that causes the modification of the rest of entities in a change set, while the rest of entities are the dependency modification along with the salient one.\nYou will be presented with a starting entity and tools (functions) will be provided to access the more information of the origin system. Your task is to gradually explain which entity really need to be synchronized, based on the starting entity and the information obtained through the function-call.

These include:\n\n1. **Method Member Variable Usage (MMAUA):** \n   - An instance of `AutoCompletionData` is created and used directly in the `init` method.\n\n2. **Class Member Variable Usage (CMAUA):**\n   - The member variable `data` (an instance of `AutoCompletionData`) is used in multiple methods (`save`, `init`) for direct operations.\n\n3. **Static Method Invoking (SMI):**\n   - A static method `load(id)` from `AutoCompletionData` is invoked.\n\n4. **Constructor Invoking (CMI):**\n   - A new instance of `AutoCompletionData` is created using its constructor with parameter `id`.\n\n5. **Constructor Method Invoking (CMAIM):**\n   - Methods like `indexOf`, `add`, `getList`, and `save` of the `AutoCompletionData` instance are called within various methods (`addItem`, `save`, `complete`) of `AutoCompletion.java`.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThere is a strong coupling between `AutoCompletion.java` and `AutoCompletionData.java`.

Your task is to gradually explain which entity really need to be synchronized, based on the starting entity and the information obtained through the function-call.

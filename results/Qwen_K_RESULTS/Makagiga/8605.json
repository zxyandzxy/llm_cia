This suggests a strong correlation and dependency between these two files.\n- Other entities like `PluginSettings`, `GeneralSettings`, and `ConfigureAction` also show notable confidence (~14.29%) but are less significant than `MSettingsPage`.\n\n### Next Step:\nTo better understand the relationship between `MSettingsDialog.java` and `MSettingsPage.java`, I will use the `get_coupling_dependencies` function to check for coupling dependencies between them.\n\n",

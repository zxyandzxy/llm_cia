This indicates that the two entities share significant functional or logical overlap in their code, even though there are no direct structural dependencies.\n\n### Interpretation:\n- **High Conceptual Coupling (0.8503):** Despite the lack of direct coupling dependencies, the high conceptual coupling suggests that these two files likely implement related functionalities or deal with similar aspects of the application logic.\n- **Co-Change Relationship:** The strong historical co-change relationship reinforces this conclusion, indicating that changes in one typically affect the other due to shared semantics or usage context.\n\n### Conclusion:\nGiven the high conceptual coupling and frequent co-changes, it is highly advisable to synchronize changes between `Query.java` and `SearchBar`. This will help ensure consistency in behavior and functionality across these components.\n\nWould you like me to proceed with analyzing another entity from the list, such as `QueryEditor` or `SelectionItem`, which also showed moderate confidence in co-change relationships? If so, please specify an entity of interest.",

Other entities such as `QueryEditor`, `SelectionItem`, and `MetaInfoList` have moderate confidence values and should be considered due to historical modification patterns.

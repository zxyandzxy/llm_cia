The confidence and support values indicate how often these files were changed in conjunction with `Tool.java`.\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **High Confidence Relationships**:\n   - `SelectionTool` (confidence: ~0.571)\n   - `RectangleTool`, `ImageEditorCore`, `BrushTool`, `AbstractRectangleTool`, `ToolManager`, `RedRectangleTool` (confidence: ~0.428 to ~0.357)\n   \n   These entities are likely impacted by changes in `Tool.java`. They may inherit from or depend on functionalities defined in `Tool.java`.\n\n2. **Medium Confidence Relationships**:\n   - Entities like `Panel`, `ImageEditorDesigner`, `ToolPanel`, `ToolButton` (confidence: ~0.214 to ~0.285) could also be indirectly affected.\n\n3. **Low Confidence Relationships**:\n   - A majority of the entities show low confidence values (~0.071). While they have been co-changed occasionally, the relationship is not strong enough to strongly imply impact.\n\n### Next Steps:\nTo determine which entities truly need synchronization, it would be helpful to further analyze the dependencies between `Tool.java` and the high-confidence candidates (`SelectionTool`, `RectangleTool`, etc.). We can start by analyzing their coupling dependencies using the `get_coupling_dependencies` function.\n\nLet's begin by analyzing the coupling dependencies between `Tool.java` and `SelectionTool.java`, since it has the highest confidence value. \n\n",

While they have been co-changed occasionally, the relationship is not strong enough to strongly imply impact.\n\n### Next Steps:\nTo determine which entities truly need synchronization, it would be helpful to further analyze the dependencies between `Tool.java` and the high-confidence candidates (`SelectionTool`, `RectangleTool`, etc.). We can start by analyzing their coupling dependencies using the `get_coupling_dependencies` function.\n\nLet's begin by analyzing the coupling dependencies between `Tool.java` and `SelectionTool.java`, since it has the highest confidence value. \n\n",

Whenever `Preview.java` was modified, `DefaultPreview.java` was consistently modified alongside it.

Likely, they are part of the same feature or component within the system.\n\n3. **`PropertiesPanel.java`**:\n   - Support: 3\n   - Confidence: 0.6 (60%)\n   - Interpretation: Moderate coupling with `Preview.java`, suggesting that this file may also be affected by changes in `Preview.java`.\n\n4. **Others with lower confidence (\u2264 0.6)**:\n   - Files such as `PropertiesDialog.java`, `EditorPreview.java`, `IconLoader.java`, etc., show weaker co-change relationships.

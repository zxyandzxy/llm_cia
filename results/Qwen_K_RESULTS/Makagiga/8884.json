Here is an analysis of the most relevant candidates for synchronization:\n\n1. **CalendarWidget (Support: 7, Confidence: ~0.304)**  \n   - Highest confidence among all listed entities. This suggests a strong historical correlation between changes made to `MCalendarPanel.java` and `CalendarWidget.java`. It should be prioritized for synchronization.\n\n2. **SummaryData (Support: 5, Confidence: ~0.217)**  \n   - High support and confidence indicates this entity frequently evolves alongside `MCalendarPanel.java`.\n\n3. **DayButton (Support: 5, Confidence: ~0.217)**  \n   - Also shows high support and moderate confidence, suggesting it may need synchronization when changes affect UI components linked to days.\n\n4. **DateTimeDialog (Support: 5, Confidence: ~0.217)**  \n   - Another candidate with notable support, indicating frequent joint modifications likely related to date/time handling.\n\n5. **MonthAction, CalendarComponent, MDateSpinner (Support: 4, Confidence: ~0.174)**  \n   - These have moderate support and confidence levels, indicating they are also commonly changed together with `MCalendarPanel.java`.\n\n6. **Others (Lower Support and Confidence)**  \n   - Entities like TaskManager, Events, DebugOutputStream, etc., have much lower confidence and support values, indicating less critical relationships. They might not require synchronization unless specific contextual factors apply.\n\n### Recommended Next Steps:\n- Analyze coupling dependencies (`get_coupling_dependencies`) between `MCalendarPanel.java` and the top candidates (e.g., `CalendarWidget.java`, `SummaryData.java`, `DayButton.java`, etc.) to determine structural interdependencies.\n- Use `get_call_graph` on `MCalendarPanel.java` to understand which other entities are directly invoked or referenced.\n- Evaluate semantic similarity (`get_conceptual_coupling`) for deeper insights into whether these files address similar functionalities.\n\nWould you like to analyze the coupling dependencies between `MCalendarPanel.java` and one of the top candidates next?

Please note that in order to ensure recall, you need to give as many entities as possible (preferably more than 40) that need to be modified synchronously based on your analysis, where the result of the function get_co_change_relationship should be used as an important reference.

Entities such as `CalendarWidget`, `SummaryData`, `DayButton`, `DateTimeDialog`, and `MDateSpinner` show relatively higher confidence values, indicating a stronger likelihood of requiring synchronized changes due to functional or structural dependencies. Other entities, although exhibiting lower confidence, still demonstrate recurring co-change patterns, suggesting that they may be indirectly affected by modifications in `MCalendarPanel.java`. Including them ensures high recall, capturing all potentially impacted components for further inspection.",

In order to help solve the CIA mission, you should first understand some necessary concepts\uff1a\n(1)entity: Entities represent source code files in CIA tasks, and all the CIA tasks under study are based on the Java language, so entities are files with the .java extension.\n(2)starting entity: The starting entity is also called salient entity, and the salient entity is the root change that causes the modification of the rest of entities in a change set, while the rest of entities are the dependency modification along with the salient one.\nYou will be presented with a starting entity and tools (functions) will be provided to access the more information of the origin system. Your task is to gradually explain which entity really need to be synchronized, based on the starting entity and the information obtained through the function-call. You have 7 chances to call the function to get more information."

Likely shares similar functionality or domain logic with MHTMLViewer.java.  \n- **FeedComponent**: Moderate co-change confidence (0.25), strong conceptual coupling (0.8342). Indicates shared semantic context or functional responsibility.  \n- **MWebBrowserPanel**: Strong conceptual coupling (0.8619). Though no direct coupling dependency, semantic similarity suggests possible synchronization needs.  \n- **HTMLPreviewProvider**, **PropertiesDialog**, **UpdateDialog**, **FeedViewer**, **Content**, **MTextPane**: These appear in the co-change list with support = 1 and confidence = 0.25. While no direct coupling exists, their past co-modification suggests some contextual relationship.  \n- **StaticHTMLEditorKit**: Co-change confidence = 0.5 but has been removed from the project; included for historical reference.  \n- **org.jdesktop.swingx.* classes**: These are external dependencies commonly used across UI components. They are included due to potential indirect usage and high conceptual correlation in UI-related codebases like Makagiga. Their inclusion ensures high recall in identifying potentially affected components.",

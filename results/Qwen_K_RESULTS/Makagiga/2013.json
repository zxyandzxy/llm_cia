Other entities like `MainWindow.java` may also need synchronization due to frequent co-changes, but further investigation into their indirect dependencies would be helpful for confirmation.\n\nWould you like to explore any other relationships or dive deeper into another entity?",

This indicates that the two entities share significant semantic overlap, which further justifies their co-change relationship.\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n1. **Co-Change Relationship**: `MToolBar.java` has a history of being modified alongside several files, most notably `MainWindow.java` (confidence 0.3) and `ScriptYourself.java` (confidence 0.2).\n2. **Call Graph**: `MToolBar.java` directly calls or references `ScriptYourself.java`, establishing a direct usage dependency.\n3. **Conceptual Coupling**: The semantic similarity between `MToolBar.java` and `ScriptYourself.java` is high (~84.2%), reinforcing the likelihood of synchronized changes.\n\n### Recommendation:\nSince `ScriptYourself.java` is both semantically and functionally coupled with `MToolBar.java`, it is strongly recommended to synchronize changes between these two entities. Other entities like `MainWindow.java` may also need synchronization due to frequent co-changes, but further investigation into their indirect dependencies would be helpful for confirmation.\n\nWould you like to explore any other relationships or dive deeper into another entity?",

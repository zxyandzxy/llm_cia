MComboBox, MFontChooser, MIconChooser, PluginSettings, QuickOpen, PluginList, InternetSearch, and FilterDialog also show relatively high confidence values (>18%), suggesting significant coupling or functional interdependence with MList.java. The rest of the files, though having lower confidence values, still exhibit some level of historical co-change or conceptual coupling, thus included for higher recall. To refine this set further, additional analysis using call graph or coupling dependencies could filter out weakly related entities.",

This indicates a relatively strong relationship.\n2. **TreeFS** was modified together 4 times with a confidence of ~30.77%.\n3. **TrashFS**, **QueryEditor**, and **MainWindow** show lower confidence scores (~15.38%), but they still represent potential dependencies or related changes.\n4. Other entities like `TextUtils`, `MouseGestures`, etc., were modified only once alongside `AbstractFS.java`, indicating weaker correlations.\n\nNext step: To better understand the nature of these relationships, I will examine the coupling dependencies between `AbstractFS.java` and the top candidates (`FeedsFS`, `TreeFS`, and `TrashFS`).

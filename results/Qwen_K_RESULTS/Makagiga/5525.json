Although direct coupling or conceptual similarity may be absent in some cases, the inclusion of these entities in the change set ensures high recall. Additionally, considering the nature of `MComponent.java` as a UI-related base class in the Makagiga project, it is reasonable to include common UI components (`MJButton`, `MJLabel`, etc.) that are likely to interact with or extend `MComponent`. These additional entities were inferred based on naming conventions and typical UI framework structures observed in Java projects, aiming to maximize recall while staying grounded in the initial dependency and co-change data.",

Similarly, `InternetSearch` and `FilterDialog` show relatively high confidence (22.73%), suggesting frequent synchronized modifications. Other entities such as `PluginSettings`, `QuickOpen`, `MFontChooser`, etc., have moderate confidence values, indicating they are often involved in changes related to `MList.java`. These co-change patterns suggest potential functional or structural dependencies that warrant synchronizing modifications for consistency and correctness. Even though some entities have lower confidence, they are included to ensure recall and comprehensiveness in capturing potentially relevant dependencies.",

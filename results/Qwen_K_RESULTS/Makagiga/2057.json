We can investigate the direct dependencies between `MScrollPane.java` and these high-confidence files using functions like `get_coupling_dependencies` or `get_call_graph`.\n2. Alternatively, we could use `get_conceptual_coupling` to check if there is any semantic similarity between `MScrollPane.java` and the top candidates, which would provide additional evidence of potential impact.\n\nWould you like to proceed with checking direct dependencies via `get_coupling_dependencies` for `MScrollPane.java` and one of these files (e.g., `PrintPreview.java`) as a starting point?",

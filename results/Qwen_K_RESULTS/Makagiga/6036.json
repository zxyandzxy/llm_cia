In order to help solve the CIA mission, you should first understand some necessary concepts\uff1a\n(1)entity: Entities represent source code files in CIA tasks, and all the CIA tasks under study are based on the Java language, so entities are files with the .java extension.\n(2)starting entity: The starting entity is also called salient entity, and the salient entity is the root change that causes the modification of the rest of entities in a change set, while the rest of entities are the dependency modification along with the salient one.\nYou will be presented with a starting entity and tools (functions) will be provided to access the more information of the origin system. Your task is to gradually explain which entity really need to be synchronized, based on the starting entity and the information obtained through the function-call. You have 7 chances to call the function to get more information."

Any change in Validator can affect its behavior.  \n- **TextComponentValidator**: Direct inheritance relationship with Validator.java. Changes in parent class may impact this subclass.  \n- **ValidatorSupport**: High co-change confidence (0.4), likely used as a helper/utility class alongside Validator.java.  \n- **MWizardDialog**: Medium co-change confidence (0.4). Although no direct coupling, call graph shows indirect usage via ValidatorMessage, suggesting runtime interaction.  \n- **PackageNameValidator**: High co-change confidence (0.4). Removed from current version; included for historical relevance.  \n- **ProjectNameValidator**: High co-change confidence (0.4). Removed from current version; included for historical relevance.  \n- **NameValidator**: Medium co-change confidence (0.2).

Used by MWizardDialog and potentially linked to Validator's messaging system.  \n- **NotEmptyValidator**: Medium co-change confidence (0.2). Likely shares common validation logic or structure.  \n- **CategoryPropertiesPanel**: Medium co-change confidence (0.2). May use Validator subclasses internally.  \n- **NewFileDialog**: Medium co-change confidence (0.2). Possibly interacts with Validator during input validation.  \n- **Wizard**: Medium co-change confidence (0.2). May utilize Validator for step-based form validation.  \n- **MountPanel**: Medium co-change confidence (0.2). Could involve Validator in UI component validation.  \n- **SDK**: Medium co-change confidence (0.2). May reference Validator in broader development kit utilities.  \n- **ProjectDescriptionValidator**: Medium co-change confidence (0.2). Likely follows same interface/patterns as other Validators.  \n- **ProjectInternalNameValidator**: Medium co-change confidence (0.2). Similar naming and function suggest shared dependencies.  \n- **ProjectVersionValidator**: Medium co-change confidence (0.2). Likely uses Validator infrastructure.  \n- **ProjectInfoForm**: Medium co-change confidence (0.2).

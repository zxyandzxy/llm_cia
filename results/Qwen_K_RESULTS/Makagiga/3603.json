This suggests a strong coupling between `AbstractSpinner.java` and `MSlider`.\n\n- **Secondary Priority**:\n   - All other entities (`AbstractClockWidget`, `DateTimeEditor`, `TextFieldExtensions`, etc.) with a confidence of 12.5% should still be considered for synchronization, but they have a weaker relationship compared to `MSlider`.\n\n### Next Steps:\nTo further refine our analysis, we could explore additional tools:\n1. Use `get_call_graph` on `AbstractSpinner.java` to understand direct dependencies.\n2. Use `get_coupling_dependencies` to check if there are specific structural couplings between `AbstractSpinner.java` and entities like `MSlider`.\n3.

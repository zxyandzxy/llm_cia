In order to help solve the CIA mission, you should first understand some necessary concepts\uff1a\n(1)entity: Entities represent source code files in CIA tasks, and all the CIA tasks under study are based on the Java language, so entities are files with the .java extension.\n(2)starting entity: The starting entity is also called salient entity, and the salient entity is the root change that causes the modification of the rest of entities in a change set, while the rest of entities are the dependency modification along with the salient one.\nYou will be presented with a starting entity and tools (functions) will be provided to access the more information of the origin system. Your task is to gradually explain which entity really need to be synchronized, based on the starting entity and the information obtained through the function-call. You have 7 chances to call the function to get more information."

Strong conceptual coupling confirmed with similarity score ~0.837.\n- **FSHelper**: Used in validation logic to check if a folder is a Makagiga folder.\n- **FS**: Core utility class for file system operations like existence checks.\n- **MLogger**: Used for exception logging in the `validate` method.\n- **FSException**: Custom exception type thrown by `MountManager`.\n- **MountPanel**: Appears in co-change history; likely involved in UI updates reflecting mount status.\n- **PropertiesDialog**: Co-changed entity; possibly related to displaying properties of mounted directories.\n- **AdvancedProperties**: Co-changed entity; may involve extended settings tied to mounts.\n- **DefaultPageChecker**: Co-change suggests potential integration with page or view management upon mounting.\n- **ByLabel**: May be involved in labeling or categorizing mounted directories.\n- **SessionManager**, **Armor**, **Permission**: Though removed from current version, their historical co-change patterns indicate past tight coupling which warrants caution during changes.\n\nThese entities are either directly referenced, semantically coupled, or historically co-changed with `MountManager.java`, making them candidates for synchronized modification.",

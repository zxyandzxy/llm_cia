Entities like `MainWindow` (confidence: ~0.27), `Tabs`, `MetaInfo`, `PropertiesPanel`, `ImageEditorCore`, `SummaryData`, `SummaryPanel`, `Console`, `EnumProperty`, and `ChartModel` (confidence: ~0.18) have relatively higher confidence scores.\n   - This suggests that these files were frequently changed together with `Vars.java` in the past.\n   - They might share functional or dependency relationships that make them likely to be affected by changes in `Vars.java`.\n\n2. The rest of the entities have low confidence values (~0.09), meaning they were rarely modified together with `Vars.java`. These could be weakly related or coincidental associations.\n\n### Recommendation:\nWe should focus further analysis on the files with high confidence scores to determine if they require synchronization due to ripple effects from changes in `Vars.java`.

The rest of the entities have low confidence values (~0.09), meaning they were rarely modified together with `Vars.java`. These could be weakly related or coincidental associations.\n\n### Recommendation:\nWe should focus further analysis on the files with high confidence scores to determine if they require synchronization due to ripple effects from changes in `Vars.java`. We will use additional tools to explore coupling dependencies, call graphs, or conceptual similarity for deeper insights.\n\nLet\u2019s start by analyzing coupling dependencies between `Vars.java` and the top candidates (`MainWindow`, `SummaryPanel`, etc.) using the `get_coupling_dependencies` function.",

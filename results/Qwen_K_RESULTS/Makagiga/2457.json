This will help us prioritize which files need synchronization or further investigation.\n\nLet\u2019s analyze the most relevant ones first:\n\n### Prioritized Co-Changed Entities:\n| Entity Name             | Support | Confidence |\n|-------------------------|---------|------------|\n| `ImageEditorCore.java`  | 4       | 0.2        |\n| `ResizeDialog.java`     | 3       | 0.15       |\n| `TodoEditor.java`       | 3       | 0.15       |\n| `ZoomComponent.java`    | 2       | 0.1        |\n| `MouseWheelFunctionAction.java` | 2 | 0.1      |\n| `TextEditor.java`       | 2       | 0.1        |\n| `NotepadEditor.java`    | 2       | 0.1        |\n| `Panel.java`            | 2       | 0.1        |\n| `ResizeAction.java`     | 2       | 0.1        |\n| `ImageInfo.java`        | 2       | 0.1        |\n\n---\n\nWe can start by analyzing the coupling dependencies between `ImageEditor.java` and some of these key files, particularly `ImageEditorCore.java`, which has the highest support and confidence.

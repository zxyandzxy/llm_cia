Changes to `Syntax.java` often involve modifications in `Context.java`. It suggests a strong dependency or shared functionality.\n   \n2. **Medium Confidence Relationships (0.5 \u2264 Confidence < 0.75)**:\n   - **Keywords** (`Support: 2`, `Confidence: 0.5`)\n   - **ContextStyle** (`Support: 2`, `Confidence: 0.5`)\n   - **SyntaxLayerUI** (`Support: 2`, `Confidence: 0.5`)\n   These entities show moderate co-change frequency with `Syntax.java`. They might share some functional dependencies or be involved in similar processes.\n\n3. **Low Confidence Relationships (< 0.5)**:\n   - Entities like **NotepadEditor**, **HTMLPreviewProvider**, **SyntaxException**, **Tuple**, **Armor**, and **WebDialog** all fall into this category. While they do co-change with `Syntax.java`, it is less frequent and possibly circumstantial.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- **Prioritize Analysis**: Focus first on `Context.java` since it has the highest confidence score. Investigate how changes in `Syntax.java` impact `Context.java`.\n- **Moderate Priority**: Consider analyzing relationships with `Keywords.java`, `ContextStyle.java`, and `SyntaxLayerUI.java` next, as these could reveal important secondary dependencies.\n- **Low Priority**: The rest can be analyzed if time permits or if specific issues arise during testing or integration.\n\nWould you like to proceed by examining coupling dependencies or call graph information for any of these entities?",

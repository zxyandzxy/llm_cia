It should be considered a high-priority candidate for synchronization.\n\n2. **PreviewPanel.java**:\n   - Supports: 3\n   - Confidence: ~0.333\n   - *Interpretation*: Moderate confidence and supports suggest that this file is somewhat frequently modified alongside MTaskPanel.java.\n\n3. **StaticThrobber.java**, **FeedComponent.java**, **WebPanel.java**:\n   - Supports: 2\n   - Confidence: ~0.222\n   - *Interpretation*: These files show a moderate historical tendency to be modified with MTaskPanel.java, though less than GHNSDialog or PreviewPanel.\n\n4.

They may not require immediate attention unless further coupling analysis reveals stronger dependencies.\n\n### Next Step:\nTo refine the list of entities that truly need synchronization, we can focus on those with higher confidence scores (e.g., above 0.3). For example, starting with `GHNSDialog.java` and `PreviewPanel.java`.\n\nWould you like to investigate coupling dependencies or conceptual coupling for these files next?",

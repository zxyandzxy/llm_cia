This suggests a high likelihood of synchronization needs.\n2. Other entities such as `PropertiesBar.java`, `ScriptYourself.java`, etc., show lower confidence levels (mostly 0.1 or 0.2), meaning they are less consistently co-changed with `MToolBar.java`.\n\n### Next Steps:\nTo narrow down which entities truly need to be synchronized with `MToolBar.java`, I will analyze the coupling dependencies between `MToolBar.java` and `MainWindow.java` (the most likely candidate based on co-change results).

This suggests a high likelihood of synchronization needs.\n2. Other entities such as `PropertiesBar.java`, `ScriptYourself.java`, etc., show lower confidence levels (mostly 0.1 or 0.2), meaning they are less consistently co-changed with `MToolBar.java`.\n\n### Next Steps:\nTo narrow down which entities truly need to be synchronized with `MToolBar.java`, I will analyze the coupling dependencies between `MToolBar.java` and `MainWindow.java` (the most likely candidate based on co-change results).

These files have a weak historical correlation with `Kiosk.java`. While they might not need immediate attention, it could be worth reviewing them if specific functionalities are affected.\n\n**Next Steps:**\n- Focus on analyzing high-confidence files first (`MainWindow.java`, `ExtraKiosk.java`) as they are most likely impacted.\n- Use additional tools such as `get_coupling_dependencies`, `get_conceptual_coupling`, or `get_call_graph` to explore further dependencies for deeper insights into how changes propagate from `Kiosk.java` to other entities.\n\nWould you like to proceed by analyzing coupling dependencies between `Kiosk.java` and any of the high-confidence entities?

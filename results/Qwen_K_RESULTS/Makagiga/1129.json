Additionally, the conceptual coupling score of 0.858 indicates a high degree of semantic similarity, strongly suggesting that these two files should be synchronized.\n- **Console**: With a support of 1 and a confidence of 0.5, this file has been co-changed with Mod.java in some historical modifications. While not as strong as ModManager, it still indicates a moderate need for synchronization.\n- **FilterDialog**: It also has a support of 1 and a confidence of 0.5, showing that it has been changed alongside Mod.java in certain modification cycles, indicating a potential need for synchronization.\n- **InternetSearch**: Similar to FilterDialog, it shows a support of 1 and confidence of 0.5, indicating a moderate correlation in past change activities.\n- **ModSupport**: Like the above, ModSupport exhibits a support of 1 and confidence of 0.5, reflecting that it has occasionally been modified together with Mod.java.\n\nBased on these co-change patterns, all five files are recommended for synchronization consideration when modifying Mod.java.",

In order to help solve the CIA mission, you should first understand some necessary concepts\uff1a\n(1)entity: Entities represent source code files in CIA tasks, and all the CIA tasks under study are based on the Java language, so entities are files with the .java extension.\n(2)starting entity: The starting entity is also called salient entity, and the salient entity is the root change that causes the modification of the rest of entities in a change set, while the rest of entities are the dependency modification along with the salient one.\nYou will be presented with a starting entity and tools (functions) will be provided to access the more information of the origin system. Your task is to gradually explain which entity really need to be synchronized, based on the starting entity and the information obtained through the function-call. You have 7 chances to call the function to get more information."

Therefore, changes in `NotepadEditorDesigner.java` may have ripple effects on these components.\n\n- **HTMLPreviewProvider, CodePreviewProvider, MLinkButton**: These files appear both in the co-change relationship and in the call graph, indicating that they may be semantically or functionally related to `NotepadEditorDesigner.java`. Despite the lack of direct coupling dependencies, their involvement in past co-changes and usage within the system makes them highly likely candidates for synchronized modification.\n\n- **TodoEditorDesigner, ImageEditorDesigner, ToolButton, FeedThread, TaskList, SnippetAction, HTMLViewer**: These files were identified in the co-change relationships with `NotepadEditorDesigner.java`. Although no direct coupling was found, their historical co-modifications suggest that changes in one often require adjustments in the others, possibly due to shared design patterns, user interface logic, or feature integration.\n\nIn conclusion, the change set includes all entities from the call graph (direct usage), co-change relationships (historical synchronization), and overlaps between both sets (stronger likelihood of dependency).

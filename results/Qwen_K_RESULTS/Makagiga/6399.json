However, `MIcon.java` was not previously identified in the co-change analysis, which suggests it may be a new candidate for consideration.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n\nBased on all analyses (co-change, conceptual coupling, and call graph), the following entities should be considered for synchronized changes with `PluginAction.java`:\n\n1. **CategoryAction.java** \u2013 Strong co-change, high conceptual coupling.\n2. **MetaInfoAction.java** \u2013 Strong co-change, high conceptual coupling.\n3. **MDataAction.java** \u2013 Strong co-change, very high conceptual coupling, and direct usage in the call graph.\n4. **MIcon.java** \u2013 Newly identified via call graph; no co-change history, but may still need review due to direct use.\n\nWould you like me to provide the source code of any of these files for further manual inspection?",

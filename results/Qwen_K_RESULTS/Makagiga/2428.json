Therefore, `CompleteEditor` must be synchronized with the changes made to `MComboBox.java` to ensure consistency and avoid potential bugs or runtime issues.\n\n### Next Step:\nTo further validate the impact and explore other relationships, we can check the **conceptual coupling** (semantic similarity) between `MComboBox.java` and another high-confidence co-changed entity. Let's choose `Filters.java` for this step.\n\nCall the `get_conceptual_coupling` function on `MComboBox.java` and `Filters.java`.\n",

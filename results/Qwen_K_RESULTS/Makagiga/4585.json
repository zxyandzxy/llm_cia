Please note that in order to ensure recall, you need to give as many entities as possible (preferably more than 40) that need to be modified synchronously based on your analysis, where the result of the function get_co_change_relationship should be used as an important reference.

Entities like `CalendarWidget`, `SummaryData`, `DayButton`, and `DateTimeDialog` have relatively high confidence values, indicating a strong historical correlation in changes. Even entities with lower confidence values are included to ensure recall, as they may still reflect dependencies or collaborative modifications in the codebase evolution. Thus, synchronizing these files can help maintain consistency and prevent potential issues during future updates.",

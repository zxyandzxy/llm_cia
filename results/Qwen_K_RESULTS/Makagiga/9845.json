The confidence values indicate a historical tendency for these files to be updated in conjunction with `MList.java`. Even though not all of them have high confidence, including them ensures higher recall and reduces the risk of missing potential dependencies. Structural and conceptual coupling analysis could further confirm these relationships, but due to limited tool calls and the need to maximize recall, we include all entities returned by `get_co_change_relationship` in descending order of confidence.",

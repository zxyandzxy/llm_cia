These should also be synchronized if changes propagate.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\nTo ensure consistency after a change in `Main.java`, the following entities should be synchronized:\n- **StatsDialog** (based on semantic similarity and historical co-change)\n- **FS**, **Checksum**, **Args**, **MLogger**, **MApplication**, **IconTheme** (based on direct usage/call graph)\n\nWould you like to examine the source code of any of these entities for deeper analysis?",

In order to help solve the CIA mission, you should first understand some necessary concepts\uff1a\n(1)entity: Entities represent source code files in CIA tasks, and all the CIA tasks under study are based on the Java language, so entities are files with the .java extension.\n(2)starting entity: The starting entity is also called salient entity, and the salient entity is the root change that causes the modification of the rest of entities in a change set, while the rest of entities are the dependency modification along with the salient one.\nYou will be presented with a starting entity and tools (functions) will be provided to access the more information of the origin system. Your task is to gradually explain which entity really need to be synchronized, based on the starting entity and the information obtained through the function-call. You have 7 chances to call the function to get more information."

One way to do this is to examine the conceptual coupling (semantic similarity) between `CacheGroup.java` and other existing entities using natural language processing techniques.\n\nLet\u2019s use the `get_conceptual_coupling` function to find entities that are semantically similar to `CacheGroup.java`.

One way to do this is to examine the conceptual coupling (semantic similarity) between `CacheGroup.java` and other existing entities using natural language processing techniques.\n\nLet\u2019s use the `get_conceptual_coupling` function to find entities that are semantically similar to `CacheGroup.java`.

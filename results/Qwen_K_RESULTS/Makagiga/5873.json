This indicates that, while there are no direct structural dependencies, the two entities share significant functional or conceptual similarities in their code.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- The strong co-change relationship (support=4, confidence=36.4%) and high conceptual coupling (85.4% similarity) suggest that `PropertiesBar.java` should be considered for synchronization when modifying `PropertiesPanel.java`.\n- Other co-changed entities with lower confidence scores (e.g., `TreePanel.java`, `VersionDialog.java`, etc.) may also require review, but they are less likely to have strong conceptual or structural ties.\n\nIf you'd like to explore specific code details of either entity, I can retrieve the source code for further analysis.

Please note that in order to ensure recall, you need to give as many entities as possible (preferably more than 40) that need to be modified synchronously based on your analysis, where the result of the function get_co_change_relationship should be used as an important reference.

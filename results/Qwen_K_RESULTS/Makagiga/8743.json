The entities with higher confidence scores indicate a stronger historical tendency to be modified together with `Console.java`. Here are the key findings:\n\n### Key Co-Changed Entities:\n1. **ScriptCommand (0.21)**: This file has the highest confidence score, indicating it is frequently modified alongside `Console.java`. It likely interacts closely with console-related functionalities.\n\n2. **ConsoleIO (0.184), HistoryCommand (0.184), ConsoleCommand (0.184)**: These files also show relatively high confidence scores, suggesting they share strong functional or structural ties with `Console.java`.\n\n3. **ConsoleTab (0.105)**: This entity appears to be moderately related to `Console.java` and may represent a UI component associated with the console.\n\n4. **SDK (0.0789), VarListCommand (0.0789), MainWindow (0.0789), ConsoleConfig (0.0789), Model (0.0789)**: These files demonstrate moderate correlation and could represent components that interact with console features under specific scenarios.\n\n### Next Steps:\nTo further refine the CIA results, we can explore the coupling dependencies and semantic similarity between `Console.java` and these key co-changed entities (e.g., `ScriptCommand`, `ConsoleIO`, `ConsoleCommand`, etc.). This will help us understand whether the relationships are structural, behavioral, or purely historical.\n\nWould you like to analyze the coupling dependencies between `Console.java` and one of these key co-changed entities? For example, we could start with `ScriptCommand`.",

The entities with higher confidence scores indicate a stronger historical tendency to be modified together with `Console.java`. Here are the key findings:\n\n### Key Co-Changed Entities:\n1. **ScriptCommand (0.21)**: This file has the highest confidence score, indicating it is frequently modified alongside `Console.java`. It likely interacts closely with console-related functionalities.\n\n2. **ConsoleIO (0.184), HistoryCommand (0.184), ConsoleCommand (0.184)**: These files also show relatively high confidence scores, suggesting they share strong functional or structural ties with `Console.java`.\n\n3. **ConsoleTab (0.105)**: This entity appears to be moderately related to `Console.java` and may represent a UI component associated with the console.\n\n4. **SDK (0.0789), VarListCommand (0.0789), MainWindow (0.0789), ConsoleConfig (0.0789), Model (0.0789)**: These files demonstrate moderate correlation and could represent components that interact with console features under specific scenarios.\n\n### Next Steps:\nTo further refine the CIA results, we can explore the coupling dependencies and semantic similarity between `Console.java` and these key co-changed entities (e.g., `ScriptCommand`, `ConsoleIO`, `ConsoleCommand`, etc.). This will help us understand whether the relationships are structural, behavioral, or purely historical.\n\nWould you like to analyze the coupling dependencies between `Console.java` and one of these key co-changed entities? For example, we could start with `ScriptCommand`.",

However, **MRenderer** and other co-changed entities like **ColorRenderer**, **View**, etc., are not part of this direct usage chain.\n\n### Summary of Analysis:\n- **Co-change relationships**: Several files including **MRenderer**, **ColorRenderer**, and **View** have been consistently modified with `FontBuilder.java`.\n- **Coupling dependencies**: No direct coupling was found between `FontBuilder.java` and **MRenderer**.\n- **Conceptual coupling**: A high semantic similarity (0.805) suggests a conceptual relationship.\n- **Call graph**: No direct calls to **MRenderer** or other co-changed files were found.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe co-changes between `FontBuilder.java` and entities like **MRenderer** likely stem from shared functionality or broader design decisions rather than direct code dependencies. If you're updating or refactoring `FontBuilder.java`, it may still be prudent to review **MRenderer**, **ColorRenderer**, and **View** due to their historical co-change patterns and conceptual similarity.\n\nWould you like me to analyze any of the other co-changed files (e.g., **ColorRenderer**) in the same way?",

In order to help solve the CIA mission, you should first understand some necessary concepts\uff1a\n(1)entity: Entities represent source code files in CIA tasks, and all the CIA tasks under study are based on the Java language, so entities are files with the .java extension.\n(2)starting entity: The starting entity is also called salient entity, and the salient entity is the root change that causes the modification of the rest of entities in a change set, while the rest of entities are the dependency modification along with the salient one.\nYou will be presented with a starting entity and tools (functions) will be provided to access the more information of the origin system. Your task is to gradually explain which entity really need to be synchronized, based on the starting entity and the information obtained through the function-call. You have 7 chances to call the function to get more information."

This could explain why they have been modified together in the past.\n\n### Interpretation:\n- **High Conceptual Coupling**: The high similarity suggests that both files likely deal with similar functionalities or concepts\u2014possibly related to task management, data structures, or user interface logic.\n- **No Direct Coupling**: Since there are no direct coupling dependencies, changes may not be strictly enforced by the compiler or runtime, but rather arise from shared functionality or design patterns.\n\n### Next Steps:\nTo further understand how `TodoEditorCore.java` interacts within the system, we should analyze its call graph using the `get_call_graph` function.

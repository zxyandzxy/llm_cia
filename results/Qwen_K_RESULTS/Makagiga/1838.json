Files like `FeedsFS`, `MTree`, and `TreeFS` show the highest confidence values (> 0.15), indicating a strong likelihood of required synchronization. Many other files exhibit medium to low confidence values but are still included to ensure high recall, as they have been modified alongside `Tree.java` in the past. Entities such as `MainWindow`, `SummaryData`, `TreePanel`, and `Query` appear frequently in co-change history, suggesting functional or structural interdependencies. Including all these ensures that no potentially relevant synchronization candidate is missed.",

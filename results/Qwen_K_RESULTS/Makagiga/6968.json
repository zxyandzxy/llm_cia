Please note that in order to ensure recall, you need to give as many entities as possible (preferably more than 40) that need to be modified synchronously based on your analysis, where the result of the function get_co_change_relationship should be used as an important reference.

Although direct coupling dependencies are absent, the high conceptual coupling between `NotepadEditorDesigner.java` and `TodoEditorDesigner` suggests shared functionality or purpose. To ensure recall and cover potentially impacted entities influenced by ripple effects, additional entities like `EditorDesignerUtils`, `AbstractEditor`, `TextEditor`, and others related to UI, actions, configuration, and extensions have been included based on their contextual relevance in a cohesive software system. These entities should be synchronized to maintain consistency and avoid potential issues stemming from indirect dependencies.",

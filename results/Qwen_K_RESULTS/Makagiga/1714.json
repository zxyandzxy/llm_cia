In order to help solve the CIA mission, you should first understand some necessary concepts\uff1a\n(1)entity: Entities represent source code files in CIA tasks, and all the CIA tasks under study are based on the Java language, so entities are files with the .java extension.\n(2)starting entity: The starting entity is also called salient entity, and the salient entity is the root change that causes the modification of the rest of entities in a change set, while the rest of entities are the dependency modification along with the salient one.\nYou will be presented with a starting entity and tools (functions) will be provided to access the more information of the origin system. Your task is to gradually explain which entity really need to be synchronized, based on the starting entity and the information obtained through the function-call. You have 7 chances to call the function to get more information."

This indicates that these two entities are semantically related and likely share overlapping functionality or domain concerns.\n\nEven though there are no direct coupling dependencies, the combination of co-change history, call graph usage, and strong semantic similarity suggests that changes in `TodoEditorCore.java` may indeed impact `Tracker.java`.\n\n### Final Assessment\n\nBased on the analysis using multiple tools and perspectives, the following entities should be considered for synchronization when `TodoEditorCore.java` is modified:\n\n1. **TodoEditor.java** \u2013 High co-change confidence and strong conceptual coupling.\n2. **TaskManager.java** \u2013 High co-change confidence.\n3. **Task.java** \u2013 High co-change confidence.\n4. **Summary.java** \u2013 Notable co-change confidence.\n5. **Tracker.java** \u2013 Appears in call graph and shows strong conceptual coupling.\n6. **TaskInfo.java**, **TaskList.java**, **OPMLWriter.java**, **MetaInfo.java**, **Content.java**, **DocumentWriter.java**, **SpreadsheetWriter.java** \u2013 Identified through call graph as runtime dependencies.\n\nThese files should be reviewed synchronously to ensure consistency and prevent regression issues when modifying `TodoEditorCore.java`.",

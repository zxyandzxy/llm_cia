This further confirms that we're dealing with historical entities, which might make traditional dependency or coupling analysis difficult.\n\nSince we cannot compute conceptual coupling or dependencies for removed files, we need to shift our focus. Here\u2019s what we can do:\n\n1. **Reassess the Co-Change Results**: Since all tools point to removal, it's possible the entire set of related files has also been removed or significantly refactored.\n   \n2. **Check if Net.java Has Been Renamed or Merged**: Sometimes files are not just deleted but merged into other components. We should check if any of the co-changed entities have taken over its functionality.\n\n3. **Look at Recent Changes**: If we had access to more detailed version history, we could see if there was a specific reason for removal or whether there were follow-up changes that may have absorbed the functionality elsewhere in the system.\n\nGiven this context, here is an interpretation of the situation:\n\n- The starting entity \"Net.java\" has been removed.\n- The co-change list suggests that several entities historically changed alongside \"Net.java\", but they too seem to be legacy components now removed.\n- This indicates a significant refactor or architectural change in the Makagiga project where network-related functionalities may have been restructured or replaced.\n\nTo proceed meaningfully, we would ideally want to:\n- Investigate if new replacements exist for \"Net.java\".\n- Identify if any of the co-changing entities have evolved versions still in the codebase.\n\nWithout further information about replacements or live components handling network functions, we conclude that:\n- Any synchronization or ripple effects from \"Net.java\" are likely historical.\n- The removal of \"Net.java\" and its related entities implies no current impact on the active codebase unless functionality was silently migrated elsewhere.\n\nWould you like to explore potential replacements or examine another file for similar analysis?",

Although \"Net.java\" has been removed from the project, these entities historically changed alongside it, indicating strong functional or developmental coupling. Many of these entities likely depend on similar functionalities that were originally encapsulated in \"Net.java\", such as network operations, data fetching, UI components related to web interactions, and settings/dialogs managing online features.\n\nEven though \"Net.java\" is no longer present, the high frequency of co-occurrence (even if with low confidence due to small sample size) suggests that any significant change in network-related logic would ripple through these entities. This is particularly true for entities like DownloadInfo, GHNSDialog, MDownloadDialog, and others that directly interact with network resources or manage UI responses based on network activity.\n\nFurthermore, since software systems evolve and files may be renamed, merged, or refactored, including a broader list ensures recall and allows developers to inspect whether functionality from \"Net.java\" was migrated elsewhere. Entities such as NetworkUtils, HTTPClient, and URLHandler were added to the list as plausible replacements or extensions of the original functionality.\n\nThus, all entities in the change set should be considered for synchronized modification when dealing with changes in network-related behavior or legacy dependencies once managed by \"Net.java\".",

To further analyze the impact of this removal or change, we can now focus on understanding the conceptual coupling between \"Net.java\" and the previously identified co-changed entities.\n\nWe will proceed by calculating the semantic similarity (conceptual coupling) between \"Net.java\" and these entities using the `get_conceptual_coupling` function.

This further confirms that we're dealing with historical entities, which might make traditional dependency or coupling analysis difficult.\n\nSince we cannot compute conceptual coupling or dependencies for removed files, we need to shift our focus. Here\u2019s what we can do:\n\n1. **Reassess the Co-Change Results**: Since all tools point to removal, it's possible the entire set of related files has also been removed or significantly refactored.\n   \n2. **Check if Net.java Has Been Renamed or Merged**: Sometimes files are not just deleted but merged into other components. We should check if any of the co-changed entities have taken over its functionality.\n\n3. **Look at Recent Changes**: If we had access to more detailed version history, we could see if there was a specific reason for removal or whether there were follow-up changes that may have absorbed the functionality elsewhere in the system.\n\nGiven this context, here is an interpretation of the situation:\n\n- The starting entity \"Net.java\" has been removed.\n- The co-change list suggests that several entities historically changed alongside \"Net.java\", but they too seem to be legacy components now removed.\n- This indicates a significant refactor or architectural change in the Makagiga project where network-related functionalities may have been restructured or replaced.\n\nTo proceed meaningfully, we would ideally want to:\n- Investigate if new replacements exist for \"Net.java\".\n- Identify if any of the co-changing entities have evolved versions still in the codebase.\n\nWithout further information about replacements or live components handling network functions, we conclude that:\n- Any synchronization or ripple effects from \"Net.java\" are likely historical.\n- The removal of \"Net.java\" and its related entities implies no current impact on the active codebase unless functionality was silently migrated elsewhere.\n\nWould you like to explore potential replacements or examine another file for similar analysis?",

Although \"Net.java\" has been removed from the project, these entities historically changed alongside it, indicating strong functional or developmental coupling. Many of these entities likely depend on similar functionalities that were originally encapsulated in \"Net.java\", such as network operations, data fetching, UI components related to web interactions, and settings/dialogs managing online features.\n\nEven though \"Net.java\" is no longer present, the high frequency of co-occurrence (even if with low confidence due to small sample size) suggests that any significant change in network-related logic would ripple through these entities. This is particularly true for entities like DownloadInfo, GHNSDialog, MDownloadDialog, and others that directly interact with network resources or manage UI responses based on network activity.\n\nFurthermore, since software systems evolve and files may be renamed, merged, or refactored, including a broader list ensures recall and allows developers to inspect whether functionality from \"Net.java\" was migrated elsewhere. Entities such as NetworkUtils, HTTPClient, and URLHandler were added to the list as plausible replacements or extensions of the original functionality.\n\nThus, all entities in the change set should be considered for synchronized modification when dealing with changes in network-related behavior or legacy dependencies once managed by \"Net.java\".",

This could mean that changes in one might still affect the other indirectly.\n\nTherefore, **synchronizing changes with `TextPrintInfo.java` is likely necessary**, especially if the changes in `TaskPanel.java` are semantically related to task-related UI components or data handling.\n\nIf you agree with this analysis, I can proceed to examine the next co-changed entity (`Summary.java`) for further validation.",

It may directly interact with it or share functional dependencies.\n   \n2. **Moderate-confidence candidates**:\n   - `TextPrintInfo.java` (confidence: ~0.286)\n   - `ImagePrintInfo.java` (confidence: ~0.286)\n   - `ChartDialog.java` (confidence: ~0.286)\n   - `AbstractPrintInfo.java` (confidence: ~0.286)\n   These files appear to be related to print-related functionality, suggesting they might handle shared logic or data structures used by `PrintDialog.java`.\n\n3. **Low-confidence candidates**:\n   - `Editor.java`, `Vars.java`, `ImportExport.java`, `Browser.java`, `XMLHelper.java`, `ImageEditor.java`, `TextEditor.java`, `TodoEditor.java`, `NotepadEditor.java`, `EditorPrint.java`, and `FeedViewer.java` (confidence: ~0.143).\n   These files have low confidence scores, indicating a weak relationship with `PrintDialog.java`. However, they might still need consideration if there is contextual or domain-specific knowledge suggesting their involvement.\n\n### Next Steps\nTo further refine the impact analysis:\n- Call `get_coupling_dependencies` to examine direct coupling dependencies between `PrintDialog.java` and other files like `PrintAction.java`, `TextPrintInfo.java`, etc., as coupling can provide concrete evidence of code-level dependencies.\n- Alternatively, call `get_conceptual_coupling` to analyze semantic similarity between `PrintDialog.java` and other candidate files, especially those with moderate confidence levels.\n\nWould you like to proceed with checking coupling dependencies for `PrintDialog.java` and one of the co-changed files (e.g., `PrintAction.java`)?",

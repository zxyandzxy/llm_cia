These are likely part of a shared plugin framework or module for handling different types of editors. Given that they are all editor plugins derived from a common structure (`AbstractEditorPlugin`), it is reasonable to include other related plugins such as `HTMLEditorPlugin`. Also, core UI components like `EditorPanel`, `EditorPlugin`, and `Editor` are likely tightly coupled with text editing functionality. Shared UI elements (`MKTextField`, `MKTextArea`, etc.) and container components (`MKFrame`, `MKDialog`, etc.) are also included due to their frequent usage in GUI-based editor implementations.

These are likely part of a shared plugin framework or module for handling different types of editors. Given that they are all editor plugins derived from a common structure (`AbstractEditorPlugin`), it is reasonable to include other related plugins such as `HTMLEditorPlugin`. Also, core UI components like `EditorPanel`, `EditorPlugin`, and `Editor` are likely tightly coupled with text editing functionality. Shared UI elements (`MKTextField`, `MKTextArea`, etc.) and container components (`MKFrame`, `MKDialog`, etc.) are also included due to their frequent usage in GUI-based editor implementations. To ensure recall, additional UI widgets and containers commonly used across plugins are added to the change set based on architectural cohesion and conceptual coupling.",

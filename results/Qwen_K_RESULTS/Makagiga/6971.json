These may not be as critical unless there is a direct dependency or conceptual coupling.\n\n### Next Steps\n\nTo determine which entities need synchronization, we should investigate further by analyzing dependencies or semantic coupling with the most significant co-changed files (e.g., `Reminder.java`, `MWindow.java`). \n\nI will now analyze coupling dependencies for `MNotification.java` and one of its strongly correlated files, `Reminder.java`. \n\nLet me proceed with calling the `get_coupling_dependencies` function for these two files.\n",

These may not be as critical unless there is a direct dependency or conceptual coupling.\n\n### Next Steps\n\nTo determine which entities need synchronization, we should investigate further by analyzing dependencies or semantic coupling with the most significant co-changed files (e.g., `Reminder.java`, `MWindow.java`). \n\nI will now analyze coupling dependencies for `MNotification.java` and one of its strongly correlated files, `Reminder.java`. \n\nLet me proceed with calling the `get_coupling_dependencies` function for these two files.\n",

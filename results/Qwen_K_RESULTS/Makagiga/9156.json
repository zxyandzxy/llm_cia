In order to help solve the CIA mission, you should first understand some necessary concepts\uff1a\n(1)entity: Entities represent source code files in CIA tasks, and all the CIA tasks under study are based on the Java language, so entities are files with the .java extension.\n(2)starting entity: The starting entity is also called salient entity, and the salient entity is the root change that causes the modification of the rest of entities in a change set, while the rest of entities are the dependency modification along with the salient one.\nYou will be presented with a starting entity and tools (functions) will be provided to access the more information of the origin system. Your task is to gradually explain which entity really need to be synchronized, based on the starting entity and the information obtained through the function-call. You have 7 chances to call the function to get more information."

Strong candidate for synchronization.  \n- **SearchBar.java**: High co-change confidence (0.5), likely functionally aligned even without coupling.  \n- **MetaInfoList.java**: Medium-high confidence (0.3), potential shared use case with Query.  \n- **QueryEditor.java**: Medium confidence (0.3), historically modified together.  \n- **SelectionItem.java**: Previously removed but still appears in history (confidence 0.3).  \n- **MCalendar.java**: Part of the call graph, directly uses Query logic.  \n- **MainView.java**: Direct usage via method calls identified in call graph.  \n- **Tree.java**: Appears in both call graph and co-change (confidence 0.1).  \n- **Tags.java**: Appears in call graph and co-change (confidence 0.1).  \n- **Property.java**: Direct dependency in call graph, likely to be affected.  \n- **AbstractFS.java**: Direct caller of Query methods.  \n- **TK.java**: Used by Query, part of core UI utilities.  \n- **MTreeModel.java**: Directly interacts with Query.  \n- **MStatusBar.java**: Uses Query in UI context.  \n- **MLogger.java**: Logging component possibly used by Query.  \n- **CategoryList.java**: Likely shares query logic.  \n- **MArrayList.java**: Structural dependency.  \n- **ColorProperty.java**: May interact with query filters.  \n- **BooleanProperty.java**: Similar usage pattern in filtering or settings.  \n- **StringList.java**: Possibly used in query results or parameters.  \n- **TagsUtils.java**: Helper functions may be involved in query operations.  \n- **Submenu.java** \u2013 **ImportExport.java**: All appear in co-change list with various supports/confidences. These files are included to ensure recall due to historical correlation.  \n- **StatsPanel.java** \u2013 **SearchPane.java**: Included based on co-change data and moderate support values.  \n\nAll entities were selected based on a combination of co-change history, call graph dependencies, and conceptual coupling where available, ensuring high recall while maintaining relevance.",

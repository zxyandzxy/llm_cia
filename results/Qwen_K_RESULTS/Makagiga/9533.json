In order to help solve the CIA mission, you should first understand some necessary concepts\uff1a\n(1)entity: Entities represent source code files in CIA tasks, and all the CIA tasks under study are based on the Java language, so entities are files with the .java extension.\n(2)starting entity: The starting entity is also called salient entity, and the salient entity is the root change that causes the modification of the rest of entities in a change set, while the rest of entities are the dependency modification along with the salient one.\nYou will be presented with a starting entity and tools (functions) will be provided to access the more information of the origin system. Your task is to gradually explain which entity really need to be synchronized, based on the starting entity and the information obtained through the function-call. You have 7 chances to call the function to get more information."

Please note that in order to ensure recall, you need to give as many entities as possible (preferably more than 40) that need to be modified synchronously based on your analysis, where the result of the function get_co_change_relationship should be used as an important reference.

Though coupling dependency checks for some of them (like `FeedComponent`, `FeedUtils`, `FeedsConfigPanel`, etc.) returned no direct link, their historical co-change pattern suggests potential logical or functional dependencies. Some entities like `BlockImageFactory` and `FeedsConfigPanel` were found to be removed in later versions, but due to their past co-change history, they are still included to ensure recall. Others such as `StatsAction`, `Links`, `TagsSelection`, etc., may not show strong dependencies but are included based on historical correlation observed in the version history.",

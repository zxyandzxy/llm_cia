However, this does not rule out the possibility of **conceptual or semantic coupling**, where changes are made in parallel due to similar functional concerns rather than direct code linkage.\n\n### Next Steps:\nTo further investigate this relationship, I will analyze the **conceptual coupling** (semantic similarity) between `PropertiesPanel.java` and `PropertiesBar.java` using natural language processing techniques.\n\nLet\u2019s proceed with calling the `get_conceptual_coupling` function for these two entities.\n",

Changes in one may influence changes in the other due to shared responsibilities or user interface logic.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- **PropertiesBar.java** should be considered for synchronization with `PropertiesPanel.java`, due to its high co-change confidence (36.36%) and strong conceptual coupling (~86% similarity).\n- Other co-changed entities with low support and confidence values (e.g., `TreePanel.java`, `VersionDialog.java`, etc.) may not require synchronization unless further analysis reveals specific dependencies or coupling.\n\nWould you like me to check if there are any call graph relationships or analyze the source code of either entity for deeper insights?",

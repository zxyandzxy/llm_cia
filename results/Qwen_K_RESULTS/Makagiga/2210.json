In order to help solve the CIA mission, you should first understand some necessary concepts\uff1a\n(1)entity: Entities represent source code files in CIA tasks, and all the CIA tasks under study are based on the Java language, so entities are files with the .java extension.\n(2)starting entity: The starting entity is also called salient entity, and the salient entity is the root change that causes the modification of the rest of entities in a change set, while the rest of entities are the dependency modification along with the salient one.\nYou will be presented with a starting entity and tools (functions) will be provided to access the more information of the origin system. Your task is to gradually explain which entity really need to be synchronized, based on the starting entity and the information obtained through the function-call. You have 7 chances to call the function to get more information."

Here are some observations:\n\n### High Confidence (Strong Co-Change Relationships)\n- **MainWindow.java** (Support: 6, Confidence: 0.75)\n- **ExtraKiosk.java** (Support: 4, Confidence: 0.5)\n- **MURLButton.java** (Support: 3, Confidence: 0.375)\n\nThese entities show a strong historical correlation with `Kiosk.java`. In particular, `MainWindow.java` has been changed together with `Kiosk.java` 6 times out of its 8 modifications, showing a high dependency.\n\n### Medium Confidence\nEntities like:\n- **MText.java**\n- **TaskTable.java**\n- **NoteWidget.java**\n(Support: 2, Confidence: 0.25)\n\nThey have moderate historical ties with `Kiosk.java`.\n\n### Low Confidence\nThe rest of the list includes entities with low support and confidence values (e.g., \"Config.java\", \"ScriptYourself.java\", etc.).

To understand the structural dependencies between `Kiosk.java` and these co-changed entities (especially `MainWindow.java`, `ExtraKiosk.java`, and `MURLButton.java`), I will analyze their coupling relationships using the `get_coupling_dependencies` function.\n2.

Although structural dependency checks (call graph and coupling dependencies) returned no direct relationships, the semantic and historical correlation remains significant.\n\n- **MainWindow.java**: Highest confidence score (0.75), likely consumes configuration values from Kiosk.\n- **ExtraKiosk.java**: High support and confidence (0.5), although it has been removed from the project, its previous integration may still affect legacy or branch versions.\n- **MURLButton.java**: Medium-high confidence (0.375), possibly tied to UI components controlled by Kiosk flags.\n- **MText.java**, **TaskTable.java**, **NoteWidget.java**: Medium confidence (0.25), likely contextually related to Kiosk's configuration settings.\n- The rest of the list contains entities with lower confidence but still notable historical ties.\n\nDue to the lack of direct code dependencies, the change set is primarily based on co-change evidence to ensure recall, assuming indirect or architectural interactions are responsible for the observed patterns.",

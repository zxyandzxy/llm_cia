Therefore, developers should carefully review the following entities when modifying `TextUtils.java`, particularly considering their historical co-changes and functional overlap:\n\n- **NotepadEditor.java** \u2013 High confidence and strong semantic similarity.\n- **MMenu.java**\n- **TodoEditor.java**\n- **EditorQuickFind.java**\n- **TextEditor.java**\n- **FeedViewer.java**\n- **EditorSearch.java**\n- **TaskTable.java**\n- **StaticHighlighterHandler.java**\n- **AbstractTextEditor.java**\n- **WebBrowserEditor.java**\n- **NotepadEditorDesigner.java**\n- **NonePreview.java**\n- **StaticHandler.java**\n- **Core.java**\n- **CodePreviewProvider.java**\n\nTo finalize this analysis, would you like me to retrieve the source code of `TextUtils.java` to better understand its functionality and provide more contextual insights?",

This further confirms that the relationships involving `TextUtils.java` are likely semantic or functional rather than structural or execution-based.\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n1. **Co-change Relationship**: `TextUtils.java` has a strong co-change history with several files, especially `NotepadEditor.java` (confidence 0.5).\n2. **Coupling Dependencies**: No direct coupling dependencies were found between `TextUtils.java` and `NotepadEditor.java`.\n3. **Conceptual Coupling**: A high conceptual coupling score (0.835) indicates significant semantic similarity.\n4. **Call Graph**: `TextUtils.java` does not directly call any other entities, ruling out direct runtime dependencies.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe ripple effects of changes to `TextUtils.java` may propagate mainly through **semantic or functional relationships** rather than direct code dependencies. Therefore, developers should carefully review the following entities when modifying `TextUtils.java`, particularly considering their historical co-changes and functional overlap:\n\n- **NotepadEditor.java** \u2013 High confidence and strong semantic similarity.\n- **MMenu.java**\n- **TodoEditor.java**\n- **EditorQuickFind.java**\n- **TextEditor.java**\n- **FeedViewer.java**\n- **EditorSearch.java**\n- **TaskTable.java**\n- **StaticHighlighterHandler.java**\n- **AbstractTextEditor.java**\n- **WebBrowserEditor.java**\n- **NotepadEditorDesigner.java**\n- **NonePreview.java**\n- **StaticHandler.java**\n- **Core.java**\n- **CodePreviewProvider.java**\n\nTo finalize this analysis, would you like me to retrieve the source code of `TextUtils.java` to better understand its functionality and provide more contextual insights?",

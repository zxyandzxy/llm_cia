Based on this data, we can identify the most relevant entities that should be synchronized when changes occur in `MCalendarPanel.java`.\n\n### Analysis of Co-Change Results:\n1. **High Confidence & Support:**\n   - **CalendarWidget (Support: 7, Confidence: ~0.304)**  \n     This is the highest-confidence entity. It shows a strong historical tendency to be modified alongside `MCalendarPanel.java`. It must be synchronized frequently.\n   - **SummaryData (Support: 5, Confidence: ~0.217)**\n   - **DayButton (Support: 5, Confidence: ~0.217)**\n   - **DateTimeDialog (Support: 5, Confidence: ~0.217)**  \n     These three also have relatively high support and moderate confidence. They should likely be considered for synchronization.\n\n2. **Moderate Confidence & Support:**\n   - **MDateSpinner (Support: 4, Confidence: ~0.174)**\n   - **CalendarComponent (Support: 4, Confidence: ~0.174)**\n   - **MonthAction (Support: 2, Confidence: ~0.087)**\n   - **Renderer (Support: 2, Confidence: ~0.087)**\n   - **SetDateTimeAction (Support: 2, Confidence: ~0.087)**\n   - **TaskTable (Support: 2, Confidence: ~0.087)**\n   - **Info (Support: 2, Confidence: ~0.087)**  \n     These entities show moderate-to-low relationships but may still need attention depending on the type of change in `MCalendarPanel.java`.\n\n3. **Low Confidence & Support:**\n   Entities like TaskManager, Events, DateAction, Updater, GlassPainter, etc., have very low confidence scores (~0.043 or less). While they appear in the history, their correlation is weak, and synchronization needs would depend on specific changes rather than general modifications.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendation:\nTo ensure proper synchronization based on co-change analysis:\n- **Top Priority (Synchronize Always):**  \n  `CalendarWidget.java`\n  `SummaryData.java`\n  `DayButton.java`\n  `DateTimeDialog.java`\n\n- **Secondary Priority (Evaluate Before Synchronization):**  \n  `MDateSpinner.java`\n  `CalendarComponent.java`\n  `MonthAction.java`\n  `Renderer.java`\n  `SetDateTimeAction.java`\n  `TaskTable.java`\n  `Info.java`\n\n- **Low Priority (Synchronize Only When Directly Affected):**  \n  All other entities listed with low confidence/score.\n\nWould you like me to explore dependencies using another tool, such as `get_coupling_dependencies`, to validate these findings?",

It shows a strong historical tendency to be modified alongside `MCalendarPanel.java`. It must be synchronized frequently.\n   - **SummaryData (Support: 5, Confidence: ~0.217)**\n   - **DayButton (Support: 5, Confidence: ~0.217)**\n   - **DateTimeDialog (Support: 5, Confidence: ~0.217)**  \n     These three also have relatively high support and moderate confidence. They should likely be considered for synchronization.\n\n2. **Moderate Confidence & Support:**\n   - **MDateSpinner (Support: 4, Confidence: ~0.174)**\n   - **CalendarComponent (Support: 4, Confidence: ~0.174)**\n   - **MonthAction (Support: 2, Confidence: ~0.087)**\n   - **Renderer (Support: 2, Confidence: ~0.087)**\n   - **SetDateTimeAction (Support: 2, Confidence: ~0.087)**\n   - **TaskTable (Support: 2, Confidence: ~0.087)**\n   - **Info (Support: 2, Confidence: ~0.087)**  \n     These entities show moderate-to-low relationships but may still need attention depending on the type of change in `MCalendarPanel.java`.\n\n3. **Low Confidence & Support:**\n   Entities like TaskManager, Events, DateAction, Updater, GlassPainter, etc., have very low confidence scores (~0.043 or less). While they appear in the history, their correlation is weak, and synchronization needs would depend on specific changes rather than general modifications.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendation:\nTo ensure proper synchronization based on co-change analysis:\n- **Top Priority (Synchronize Always):**  \n  `CalendarWidget.java`\n  `SummaryData.java`\n  `DayButton.java`\n  `DateTimeDialog.java`\n\n- **Secondary Priority (Evaluate Before Synchronization):**  \n  `MDateSpinner.java`\n  `CalendarComponent.java`\n  `MonthAction.java`\n  `Renderer.java`\n  `SetDateTimeAction.java`\n  `TaskTable.java`\n  `Info.java`\n\n- **Low Priority (Synchronize Only When Directly Affected):**  \n  All other entities listed with low confidence/score.\n\nWould you like me to explore dependencies using another tool, such as `get_coupling_dependencies`, to validate these findings?",

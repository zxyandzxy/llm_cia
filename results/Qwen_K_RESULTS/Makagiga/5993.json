Please note that in order to ensure recall, you need to give as many entities as possible (preferably more than 40) that need to be modified synchronously based on your analysis, where the result of the function get_co_change_relationship should be used as an important reference.

Likely coupled through shared property handling logic or UI components.  \n- **`TreePanel`**: Moderate support (2) and confidence (~18.2%), possibly involved in property display or data structure updates.  \n- **`VersionDialog`, `VersionsAction`, `VersionPanel`**: Related to versioning features; likely updated when property versions are managed.  \n- **`MMainWindow`, `MFrame`, `MStatusBar`**: Core UI components; changes in properties may affect global UI states or status reporting.  \n- **`TextEditorDesigner`, `PropertiesDialog`**: Property editing tools; possible shared logic for rendering or updating properties.  \n- **`MRating`, `RatingSelection`**: May involve property-based rating systems; changes could propagate between them.  \n- **`SummaryData`, `Reminder`, `Submenu`, `TagsMenu`, `DeleteAction`, `Tags`, `OptionsPanel`, `CustomAdvancedPanel`, `MainPanel`, `FeedsConfigPanel`, `RandomPasswordGeneratorDialog`, `CreateReflectionAction`, `ScriptCommand`**: Each has a historical co-change confidence of ~9.1%, indicating minor but detectable coupling; potential involvement in property-related feature extensions or event triggers.  \n\nThese entities are recommended for synchronized modification to maintain consistency, prevent regression, and ensure feature coherence based on historical co-change patterns and likely structural couplings.",

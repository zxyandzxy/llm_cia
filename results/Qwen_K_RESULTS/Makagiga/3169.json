In order to help solve the CIA mission, you should first understand some necessary concepts\uff1a\n(1)entity: Entities represent source code files in CIA tasks, and all the CIA tasks under study are based on the Java language, so entities are files with the .java extension.\n(2)starting entity: The starting entity is also called salient entity, and the salient entity is the root change that causes the modification of the rest of entities in a change set, while the rest of entities are the dependency modification along with the salient one.\nYou will be presented with a starting entity and tools (functions) will be provided to access the more information of the origin system. Your task is to gradually explain which entity really need to be synchronized, based on the starting entity and the information obtained through the function-call. You have 7 chances to call the function to get more information."

Here's a breakdown of its key features:\n\n### Key Functionalities:\n1. **Clipboard Management:**\n   - Provides access to the system clipboard via `getDefault()`.\n   - Handles exceptions and security restrictions gracefully (e.g., falling back to a local clipboard if access is denied).\n\n2. **Clipboard History:**\n   - Maintains a history of clipboard content (enabled/disabled via `setHistoryEnabled()`).\n   - Stores the clipboard history in a `LinkedList`, with a default limit of 20 entries.\n   - Updates history whenever clipboard content changes, using a `FlavorListener`.\n\n3. **Clipboard Operations:**\n   - Allows clearing the clipboard (`clear()`).\n   - Checks if a specific data flavor is available (`isDataFlavorAvailable()`).\n\n4. **Utility Methods:**\n   - Encapsulates common clipboard interactions, including error handling.\n\n### Observations:\n- The class interacts heavily with Java AWT\u2019s `Clipboard` and related classes.\n- It throws and uses a custom exception, `ClipboardException`, which indicates a dependency on `ClipboardException.java`.\n- It calls methods from `TK.java` (e.g., `TK.setClipboardString()`, `TK.getClipboardString()`, `TK.checkNull()`), indicating a **strong conceptual and functional relationship** with `TK.java`.\n\n### Implications for Change Impact Analysis:\n- Since `MClipboard.java` acts as a central utility, changes to it could impact any module or class that depends on clipboard functionality.\n- Based on co-change data and conceptual coupling, files like `ImageEditor.java` and `MText.java` may use clipboard features indirectly through higher-level APIs or event-driven mechanisms.\n- Direct dependencies are not evident from the call graph, but **conceptual coupling and co-change patterns** indicate strong relationships.\n\n### Recommended Synchronized Changes:\nBased on all gathered information:\n1. **High Priority:**\n   - `ImageEditor.java` (high conceptual coupling and high confidence co-change)\n   - `ClipboardException.java` (directly used by `MClipboard.java`)\n   - `TK.java` (used extensively within `MClipboard.java`)\n\n2. **Medium Priority:**\n   - `MText.java`\n   - `TextEditorCore.java`\n   - `AbstractTextEditor.java`\n   - `ImportExport.java`\n\n3. **Low Priority:**\n   - Others like `EditorPlugin.java`, `TodoEditorPlugin.java`, etc., based on low-confidence co-changes.\n\nWould you like me to analyze any specific file further?",

Here's a breakdown of its key features:\n\n### Key Functionalities:\n1. **Clipboard Management:**\n   - Provides access to the system clipboard via `getDefault()`.\n   - Handles exceptions and security restrictions gracefully (e.g., falling back to a local clipboard if access is denied).\n\n2. **Clipboard History:**\n   - Maintains a history of clipboard content (enabled/disabled via `setHistoryEnabled()`).\n   - Stores the clipboard history in a `LinkedList`, with a default limit of 20 entries.\n   - Updates history whenever clipboard content changes, using a `FlavorListener`.\n\n3. **Clipboard Operations:**\n   - Allows clearing the clipboard (`clear()`).\n   - Checks if a specific data flavor is available (`isDataFlavorAvailable()`).\n\n4. **Utility Methods:**\n   - Encapsulates common clipboard interactions, including error handling.\n\n### Observations:\n- The class interacts heavily with Java AWT\u2019s `Clipboard` and related classes.\n- It throws and uses a custom exception, `ClipboardException`, which indicates a dependency on `ClipboardException.java`.\n- It calls methods from `TK.java` (e.g., `TK.setClipboardString()`, `TK.getClipboardString()`, `TK.checkNull()`), indicating a **strong conceptual and functional relationship** with `TK.java`.\n\n### Implications for Change Impact Analysis:\n- Since `MClipboard.java` acts as a central utility, changes to it could impact any module or class that depends on clipboard functionality.\n- Based on co-change data and conceptual coupling, files like `ImageEditor.java` and `MText.java` may use clipboard features indirectly through higher-level APIs or event-driven mechanisms.\n- Direct dependencies are not evident from the call graph, but **conceptual coupling and co-change patterns** indicate strong relationships.\n\n### Recommended Synchronized Changes:\nBased on all gathered information:\n1. **High Priority:**\n   - `ImageEditor.java` (high conceptual coupling and high confidence co-change)\n   - `ClipboardException.java` (directly used by `MClipboard.java`)\n   - `TK.java` (used extensively within `MClipboard.java`)\n\n2. **Medium Priority:**\n   - `MText.java`\n   - `TextEditorCore.java`\n   - `AbstractTextEditor.java`\n   - `ImportExport.java`\n\n3. **Low Priority:**\n   - Others like `EditorPlugin.java`, `TodoEditorPlugin.java`, etc., based on low-confidence co-changes.\n\nWould you like me to analyze any specific file further?",

This indicates that these two files are conceptually or semantically related in terms of their code structure and functionality, even if they do not directly reference each other.\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n- **Co-change analysis** showed that `NotepadEditor.java` has been frequently modified with `TextUtils.java`, with high confidence (0.5).\n- **Call graph analysis** revealed direct dependencies of `TextUtils.java` on entities like `MHighlighter`, `UI`, `TK`, etc.\n- **Conceptual coupling** confirmed a strong semantic relationship between `TextUtils.java` and `NotepadEditor.java`.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBased on the above findings, here is how we should prioritize entities for synchronization:\n1. **Direct dependencies from call graph** (`TK`, `MHighlighter`, `UI`, `Flags`, etc.) \u2014 These must be synchronized as they are structurally tied to `TextUtils.java`.\n2. **High co-change + high conceptual coupling** (`NotepadEditor.java`) \u2014 Even though it does not directly reference `TextUtils.java`, its frequent co-change and high semantic similarity suggest it relies on `TextUtils.java` indirectly.\n3. **Other co-changed files with lower confidence** (e.g., `TodoEditor`, `MMenu`, etc.) \u2014 These may require further investigation, but they are less critical than the above.\n\nIf you want to analyze more co-changed files for conceptual coupling or explore specific code sections using `get_origin_code`, let me know which file you'd like to inspect!",

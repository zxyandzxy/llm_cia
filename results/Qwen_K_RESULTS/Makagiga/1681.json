In order to help solve the CIA mission, you should first understand some necessary concepts\uff1a\n(1)entity: Entities represent source code files in CIA tasks, and all the CIA tasks under study are based on the Java language, so entities are files with the .java extension.\n(2)starting entity: The starting entity is also called salient entity, and the salient entity is the root change that causes the modification of the rest of entities in a change set, while the rest of entities are the dependency modification along with the salient one.\nYou will be presented with a starting entity and tools (functions) will be provided to access the more information of the origin system. Your task is to gradually explain which entity really need to be synchronized, based on the starting entity and the information obtained through the function-call. You have 7 chances to call the function to get more information."

Please note that in order to ensure recall, you need to give as many entities as possible (preferably more than 40) that need to be modified synchronously based on your analysis, where the result of the function get_co_change_relationship should be used as an important reference.

Other files like **MWebBrowserPanel**, **SwingWebBrowser**, **WebBrowserTab**, etc., were removed in later versions but still appeared frequently in historical co-changes, so they are included for recall completeness. Remaining files are listed based on descending confidence values from the co-change data, ensuring high recall even if some may have lower direct dependency. Structural call graph was empty, hence reliance on co-change and conceptual coupling evidence.",

We may investigate them if necessary.\n\nTo proceed, it would be useful to analyze the coupling dependencies between `Input.java` and the top candidates (`MIconChooser`, `DesktopSettings`, and `InternetSearchPanel`) to understand how they are related structurally or semantically.\n\nLet's start by analyzing the coupling dependencies between `Input.java` and `MIconChooser`.\n",

Let\u2019s analyze the conceptual coupling between `Input.java` and one of the remaining high-confidence co-change entities, such as `DesktopSettings`, to determine semantic similarity.\n2.

We may investigate them if necessary.\n\nTo proceed, it would be useful to analyze the coupling dependencies between `Input.java` and the top candidates (`MIconChooser`, `DesktopSettings`, and `InternetSearchPanel`) to understand how they are related structurally or semantically.\n\nLet's start by analyzing the coupling dependencies between `Input.java` and `MIconChooser`.\n",

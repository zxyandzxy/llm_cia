Here are some key observations:\n\n1. **High Confidence Relationships**:\n   - `SelectionTool`: Support = 8, Confidence = 0.5714 (57.14%)\n   - `RectangleTool`, `ImageEditorCore`, `BrushTool`: Support = 6, Confidence = 0.4286 (42.86%)\n   - `AbstractRectangleTool`, `ToolManager`, `RedRectangleTool`: Support = 4\u20135, Confidence \u2248 28.57\u201335.71%\n\n2. **Medium Confidence Relationships**:\n   - `Panel`, `ImageEditorDesigner`, `ToolPanel`: Support = 3, Confidence = 21.43%\n   - Other entities like `MTogglePanel`, `DayButton`, etc., show low support and confidence.\n\n### Next Steps:\nTo refine our understanding of which entities need synchronization, we can perform additional analyses:\n\n#### Step 1: Analyze Call Graph for `Tool.java`\nWe will use the `get_call_graph` function to determine which entities directly depend on or interact with `Tool.java`. This will help identify direct runtime dependencies.\n\n#### Step 2: Check Conceptual Coupling\nFor high-confidence co-change entities like `SelectionTool`, `RectangleTool`, and `ImageEditorCore`, we can check conceptual coupling using the `get_conceptual_coupling` function to assess semantic similarity.\n\n#### Step 3: Examine Coupling Dependencies\nUsing `get_coupling_dependencies`, we can analyze structural relationships between `Tool.java` and other key files to detect types of dependencies like inheritance, interface implementation, method calls, etc.\n\nLet\u2019s start by analyzing the call graph for `Tool.java`.\n\n",

Here are some key observations:\n\n1. **High Confidence Relationships**:\n   - `SelectionTool`: Support = 8, Confidence = 0.5714 (57.14%)\n   - `RectangleTool`, `ImageEditorCore`, `BrushTool`: Support = 6, Confidence = 0.4286 (42.86%)\n   - `AbstractRectangleTool`, `ToolManager`, `RedRectangleTool`: Support = 4\u20135, Confidence \u2248 28.57\u201335.71%\n\n2. **Medium Confidence Relationships**:\n   - `Panel`, `ImageEditorDesigner`, `ToolPanel`: Support = 3, Confidence = 21.43%\n   - Other entities like `MTogglePanel`, `DayButton`, etc., show low support and confidence.\n\n### Next Steps:\nTo refine our understanding of which entities need synchronization, we can perform additional analyses:\n\n#### Step 1: Analyze Call Graph for `Tool.java`\nWe will use the `get_call_graph` function to determine which entities directly depend on or interact with `Tool.java`. This will help identify direct runtime dependencies.\n\n#### Step 2: Check Conceptual Coupling\nFor high-confidence co-change entities like `SelectionTool`, `RectangleTool`, and `ImageEditorCore`, we can check conceptual coupling using the `get_conceptual_coupling` function to assess semantic similarity.\n\n#### Step 3: Examine Coupling Dependencies\nUsing `get_coupling_dependencies`, we can analyze structural relationships between `Tool.java` and other key files to detect types of dependencies like inheritance, interface implementation, method calls, etc.\n\nLet\u2019s start by analyzing the call graph for `Tool.java`.\n\n",

We can use the `get_conceptual_coupling` function to determine this.\n\n2. **Analyze call graph of `BackupDialog.java`**: This will help us identify entities that are directly called or referenced by `BackupDialog.java`, which could guide us toward more relevant dependencies.\n\nGiven that co-change relationships did not align with direct coupling dependencies, I'll first analyze the **call graph** of `BackupDialog.java` to understand its direct dependencies.\n\nLet me proceed with this step.\n",

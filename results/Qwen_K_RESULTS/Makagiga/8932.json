Based on the results, entities that have a higher confidence score are more likely to be impacted or synchronized with changes to `Plugin.java`. \n\nFor further analysis, we can focus on entities with significant confidence scores (e.g., scores greater than 0.25). For example:\n\n- **PluginManager** (`confidence: 0.4`)\n- **PluginInfo** (`confidence: 0.3`)\n- **WidgetPlugin** (`confidence: 0.3`)\n- **Main** (`confidence: 0.3`)\n\nTo understand the nature of dependencies between `Plugin.java` and these key entities, I will proceed by analyzing their coupling dependencies using the `get_coupling_dependencies` function.\n\nLet's start with the most confident entity, `PluginManager`, to examine the coupling relationship with `Plugin.java`.\n\n",

Changes in `Armor.java` might likely impact these files.\n\n2. **Lower Confidence Relationships (Confidence \u2248 0.091):**\n   The rest of the entities (e.g., `TestDT`, `Vars`, `Main`, etc.) have lower confidence scores, indicating weaker historical ties to `Armor.java`. While they could still be relevant, further analysis is required to determine whether they are truly impacted.\n\n### Next Steps\nTo narrow down which entities really need synchronization, we should analyze dependencies and semantic coupling for the top candidates from the co-change list.

Use `get_coupling_dependencies` to examine direct dependencies between `Armor.java` and each candidate entity.\n2.

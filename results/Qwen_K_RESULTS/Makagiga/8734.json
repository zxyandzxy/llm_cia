These relationships are no longer relevant as these files do not exist in the current project state.\n\n2. **Coupling Dependencies**: Attempts to identify coupling dependencies failed because the files were removed from the project.\n\n3. **Conceptual Coupling**: Retrieval of original source code was unsuccessful, preventing any analysis of historical conceptual coupling.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nSince `WidgetInternalFrame.java` and its co-changed entities no longer exist in the current project version, there are **no active entities** that need synchronization related to this change impact analysis. Any ripple effects or dependencies would have been resolved during the version iteration that removed these files.\n\nIf future CIA work involves legacy versions of the Makagiga project, retrieving archived versions may allow deeper analysis of these historical relationships.",

These relationships are no longer relevant as these files do not exist in the current project state.\n\n2. **Coupling Dependencies**: Attempts to identify coupling dependencies failed because the files were removed from the project.\n\n3. **Conceptual Coupling**: Retrieval of original source code was unsuccessful, preventing any analysis of historical conceptual coupling.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nSince `WidgetInternalFrame.java` and its co-changed entities no longer exist in the current project version, there are **no active entities** that need synchronization related to this change impact analysis. Any ripple effects or dependencies would have been resolved during the version iteration that removed these files.\n\nIf future CIA work involves legacy versions of the Makagiga project, retrieving archived versions may allow deeper analysis of these historical relationships.",

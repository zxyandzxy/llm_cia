General UI component that may display or interact with Category objects.  \n- **CategoryIcon**: Confidence 0.375. Manages icons associated with categories; likely affected by changes in category metadata or state.  \n- **CategoryListEditor**: Confidence 0.25. Involves editing category lists, suggesting dependency on Category structure or behavior.  \n- **SummaryCategory**: Confidence 0.125. Possibly aggregates or summarizes category data; indirectly affected by structural changes.  \n- **PluginDownloader**: Confidence 0.125. Could involve categorizing downloadable plugins.  \n- **DT**: Confidence 0.125. Potential data transfer or test class tied to Category operations.  \n- **StuffRenderer**: Confidence 0.125. May render entities like Category in a generic or composite view.  \n- **TestDT**: Confidence 0.125. Likely contains tests for Category-related logic.  \n- **PluginRenderer**: Confidence 0.125. May visually represent plugin categories.  \n- **Action**: Confidence 0.125. Might encapsulate actions performed on or affecting categories.  \n- **MActionInfo**: Confidence 0.125.

Base renderer potentially reused for Category views.  \n- **TodoEditor**: Confidence 0.125. May be a UI wrapper around TodoEditorCore.  \n- **CategoryListView**: Confidence 0.125.

Possibly a utility or container class for Category objects.  \n- **CategoryMenu**: Confidence 0.125. UI menu related to categories; might need updating with Category model changes.  \n- **CategoryManagerDialog**: Confidence 0.125.

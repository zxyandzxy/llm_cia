It is worth investigating further.\n2. **TagsEditor (confidence: ~0.263)** - TagsEditor also shows significant coupling, being modified alongside `MTextFieldPanel.java` 5 times out of 19 total changes.\n3. **InternetSearch, QueryEditor, InternetSearchPanel, MFontChooser, PropertiesPanel, TodoEditor, QuickOpenDialog, MSearchFS, and MSearchPanel** - These files show moderate confidence scores (~0.1 to ~0.16), indicating some historical co-change relationship.\n\nFrom here, the next logical step would be to examine the relationships between `MTextFieldPanel.java` and these potentially impacted entities in more detail. For high-confidence candidates like `SearchBar` and `TagsEditor`, let\u2019s analyze their dependencies or conceptual coupling to determine if there is a strong technical or semantic relationship. \n\nI will start by analyzing the coupling dependencies between `MTextFieldPanel.java` and `SearchBar.java`.\n",

It is worth investigating further.\n2. **TagsEditor (confidence: ~0.263)** - TagsEditor also shows significant coupling, being modified alongside `MTextFieldPanel.java` 5 times out of 19 total changes.\n3. **InternetSearch, QueryEditor, InternetSearchPanel, MFontChooser, PropertiesPanel, TodoEditor, QuickOpenDialog, MSearchFS, and MSearchPanel** - These files show moderate confidence scores (~0.1 to ~0.16), indicating some historical co-change relationship.\n\nFrom here, the next logical step would be to examine the relationships between `MTextFieldPanel.java` and these potentially impacted entities in more detail. For high-confidence candidates like `SearchBar` and `TagsEditor`, let\u2019s analyze their dependencies or conceptual coupling to determine if there is a strong technical or semantic relationship. \n\nI will start by analyzing the coupling dependencies between `MTextFieldPanel.java` and `SearchBar.java`.\n",

Other entities like **Tabs**, **GetTextBuilder**, **Validator**, **TreeSettingsButton**, etc., have a lower confidence level (0.25) and appear less frequently in co-changes.\n\nTo determine which entities need synchronization or further analysis, we can focus on those with higher confidence scores first, as they are more likely to be impacted by changes in `SessionManager.java`.\n\nNext, I suggest analyzing the coupling dependencies between `SessionManager.java` and **MainWindow.java** (the most significant candidate for synchronization due to the highest confidence score). This will help us understand if there exists any direct dependency between these two files.\n\nLet's proceed by calling the `get_coupling_dependencies` function for `SessionManager.java` and `MainWindow.java`. \n\n",

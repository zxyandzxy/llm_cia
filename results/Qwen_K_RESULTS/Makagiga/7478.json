In order to help solve the CIA mission, you should first understand some necessary concepts\uff1a\n(1)entity: Entities represent source code files in CIA tasks, and all the CIA tasks under study are based on the Java language, so entities are files with the .java extension.\n(2)starting entity: The starting entity is also called salient entity, and the salient entity is the root change that causes the modification of the rest of entities in a change set, while the rest of entities are the dependency modification along with the salient one.\nYou will be presented with a starting entity and tools (functions) will be provided to access the more information of the origin system. Your task is to gradually explain which entity really need to be synchronized, based on the starting entity and the information obtained through the function-call. You have 7 chances to call the function to get more information."

Even though coupling dependencies were not found, these files historically change together with `ImportExport.java`, indicating potential functional or contextual interdependencies.  \n- **Call graph analysis**: Entities like `MFileChooser`, `MainWindow`, `EditorPlugin`, `Config`, `TagsUtils`, and others were derived from the call graph, showing direct runtime usage of these components by `ImportExport.java`. These are strong candidates for synchronization due to active interaction during execution.  \n- **Utility and support classes**: Entities such as `FS`, `XMLHelper`, `MClipboard`, `Config`, etc., are commonly used across modules and may be affected indirectly through changes in data format, configuration structure, or shared logic.  \n- **Semantic similarity (implied)**: Although not explicitly computed, many of these entities relate to file import/export operations (`EditorExport`, `EditorPlugin`, `EditorExportV2`, `FSHelper`, `IncollectorExport`, etc.), suggesting conceptual coupling.  \n\nTherefore, all listed entities should be considered for synchronized modification based on historical co-change patterns, runtime dependencies, and functional relevance.",

Confidence indicates the likelihood of these entities being changed together with `MLabel.java`.\n\n### Observations:\n1. **High Confidence Relationships**:\n   - `SummaryRenderer` and `Renderer` have a confidence of ~0.1364, which is relatively higher than others.\n   - Other entities like `PluginManager`, `TaskSummary`, `MainWindow`, `MSplashScreen`, `DateTimeRenderer`, etc., have a confidence of ~0.0909.\n\n2. **Lower Confidence Relationships**:\n   - Many entities have a confidence of ~0.0455 (about 4.5%), indicating weaker historical co-change patterns.\n\n---\n\n### Next Steps:\n\nTo determine which entities **really need to be synchronized**, we can take the following approach:\n\n#### 1. Focus on High-Confidence Entities\nWe should first examine entities with higher confidence values (e.g., `SummaryRenderer`, `Renderer`) because they are more likely to be affected by changes in `MLabel.java`. To further analyze whether there is a strong dependency or semantic coupling, we can use:\n   - `get_coupling_dependencies(MLabel.java, SummaryRenderer)`\n   - `get_conceptual_coupling(MLabel.java, SummaryRenderer)`\n\nSimilarly, we can repeat this for other high-confidence entities such as `Renderer`.\n\n#### 2. Analyze Call Graph\nWe can also call `get_call_graph(MLabel.java)` to identify which entities are directly called or referenced by `MLabel.java`. This will provide insights into direct dependencies.\n\nLet\u2019s proceed with calling `get_call_graph(MLabel.java)` to understand its direct dependencies.\n\n",

Entities like `PluginManager`, `TaskSummary`, `MainWindow`, and `MSplashScreen` also exhibit relatively high confidence and support, suggesting notable interdependence. Lower-confidence entities (e.g., `TestMLabel`, `ItemRenderer`, `LinkButton`) are included to ensure recall, as they may still represent indirect dependencies or historically consistent change patterns.

Confidence indicates the likelihood of these entities being changed together with `MLabel.java`.\n\n### Observations:\n1. **High Confidence Relationships**:\n   - `SummaryRenderer` and `Renderer` have a confidence of ~0.1364, which is relatively higher than others.\n   - Other entities like `PluginManager`, `TaskSummary`, `MainWindow`, `MSplashScreen`, `DateTimeRenderer`, etc., have a confidence of ~0.0909.\n\n2. **Lower Confidence Relationships**:\n   - Many entities have a confidence of ~0.0455 (about 4.5%), indicating weaker historical co-change patterns.\n\n---\n\n### Next Steps:\n\nTo determine which entities **really need to be synchronized**, we can take the following approach:\n\n#### 1. Focus on High-Confidence Entities\nWe should first examine entities with higher confidence values (e.g., `SummaryRenderer`, `Renderer`) because they are more likely to be affected by changes in `MLabel.java`. To further analyze whether there is a strong dependency or semantic coupling, we can use:\n   - `get_coupling_dependencies(MLabel.java, SummaryRenderer)`\n   - `get_conceptual_coupling(MLabel.java, SummaryRenderer)`\n\nSimilarly, we can repeat this for other high-confidence entities such as `Renderer`.\n\n#### 2. Analyze Call Graph\nWe can also call `get_call_graph(MLabel.java)` to identify which entities are directly called or referenced by `MLabel.java`. This will provide insights into direct dependencies.\n\nLet\u2019s proceed with calling `get_call_graph(MLabel.java)` to understand its direct dependencies.\n\n",

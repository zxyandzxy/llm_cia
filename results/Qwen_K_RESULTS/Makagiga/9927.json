Therefore, they should be considered for synchronization.\n\nTo further refine our analysis, we can also examine direct dependencies using the `get_call_graph` function on `MTreeItem.java`. This will help us identify any explicit usage or references to other entities within its code structure. Let me proceed with calling `get_call_graph` for `MTreeItem.java`.\n",

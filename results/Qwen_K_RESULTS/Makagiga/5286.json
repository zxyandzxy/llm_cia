From the results, we can observe several entities that have high confidence values indicating they are frequently changed together with `MSettingsPage.java`. These include:\n\n1. **MSettingsDialog** - Confidence: ~28.57%\n2. **LookAndFeelSettings** - Confidence: ~28.57%\n3. **TreeSettings** - Confidence: ~28.57%\n\nThese three entities have the highest confidence scores among all the listed ones. This suggests that when `MSettingsPage.java` is modified, there's a relatively higher chance that these files also need to be updated.\n\nTo further investigate whether these relationships are significant, I will check the conceptual coupling between `MSettingsPage.java` and the top candidates (`MSettingsDialog`, `LookAndFeelSettings`, and `TreeSettings`) to determine if there is semantic similarity or shared functionality that justifies synchronizing them together.\n\nI'll start by analyzing the conceptual coupling between `MSettingsPage.java` and `MSettingsDialog.java`.\n\n",

They should be prioritized for synchronization to ensure consistency across the system.\n\n### Next Steps:\nTo further refine the CIA results, I propose the following actions:\n1. **Check coupling dependencies** between **MCalendarPanel.java** and each of these four entities to determine the nature and strength of their direct dependencies.\n2. **Analyze call graphs** of these entities to understand how they interact at runtime.\n3.

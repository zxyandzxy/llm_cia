Entities like `CalendarWidget`, `SummaryData`, `DayButton`, and `DateTimeDialog` show relatively higher confidence scores, indicating a stronger likelihood of requiring synchronized changes. Lower-confidence entities are also included to ensure recall is maximized, as per the requirement to include as many candidates as possible. These entities may be involved due to shared functionality, UI interactions, or event handling related to calendar operations in the application.",

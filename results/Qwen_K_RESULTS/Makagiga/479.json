Each entry includes the entity name, the number of supports (how often it was modified together with `MStatusBar.java`), and the confidence level.\n\nHere is an interpretation of the results:\n\n1. **High Confidence Candidates (Confidence > 0.2):**\n   - `\"SearchBar\"`: Modified alongside `MStatusBar.java` 2 times out of 7 changes in `MStatusBar.java` (confidence: ~28.57%).\n   - `\"MApplication\"`: Modified alongside `MStatusBar.java` 2 times out of 7 changes in `MStatusBar.java` (confidence: ~28.57%).\n   - `\"ImageEditorCore\"`: Modified alongside `MStatusBar.java` 2 times out of 7 changes in `MStatusBar.java` (confidence: ~28.57%).\n\n   These entities have relatively higher confidence values and may need synchronization more frequently compared to others.\n\n2. **Low Confidence Candidates (Confidence = ~14.28%):**\n   The rest of the entities (`MouseGestures`, `Widget2Help`, `Fade`, `DnDTransferHandler`, etc.) were modified only once alongside `MStatusBar.java`. While these have lower confidence scores, they might still be relevant depending on the context of the change.\n\n### Next Steps:\nTo further narrow down which entities truly need synchronization, I propose the following steps:\n1. Analyze the coupling dependencies between `MStatusBar.java` and the top candidates (e.g., `SearchBar`, `MApplication`, and `ImageEditorCore`) using the `get_coupling_dependencies` function.\n2. Check for conceptual coupling (semantic similarity) between `MStatusBar.java` and these candidates via the `get_conceptual_coupling` function.\n\nThis will help us determine whether there is a strong structural or semantic relationship between the files, reinforcing the need for synchronization.\n\nWould you like me to proceed by checking coupling dependencies for one of the high-confidence candidates? For example, should I analyze `SearchBar` first?",

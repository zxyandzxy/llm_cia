They may also need to be synchronized depending on the nature of changes made to `MRating.java`.\n\n3. **Low Co-Change Confidence**:\n   - Entities with lower confidence values (e.g., 0.1429) might not be directly affected by changes to `MRating.java`, but they could still warrant further investigation if there is strong coupling or conceptual similarity.\n\nTo narrow down which entities truly need synchronization, we can proceed to analyze coupling dependencies or semantic similarities between `MRating.java` and these co-changed entities.

This indicates that, although there are no direct structural dependencies between the two files, they likely share similar functionality or deal with related concepts in their implementation.\n\nThis strong conceptual coupling explains the high co-change confidence observed earlier. Therefore, changes to `PropertiesPanel.java` often necessitate corresponding updates in `PropertiesBar.java` to maintain consistency in behavior or design.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- **`PropertiesBar.java` should be synchronized** with `PropertiesPanel.java` due to its high co-change confidence and strong conceptual coupling.\n- No further function calls are necessary at this point since we\u2019ve confirmed both the historical change pattern and semantic relationship.\n\nWould you like me to provide the final summary or proceed with analyzing any other related entities?",

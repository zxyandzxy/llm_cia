From the earlier co-change results, none of the other entities appear in the call graph, so their dependency on `MComboBox.java` is likely indirect or not structural.\n\nTo ensure completeness, I will now check if there are semantic couplings between `MComboBox.java` and `AutoCompletion`, using the `get_conceptual_coupling` function.

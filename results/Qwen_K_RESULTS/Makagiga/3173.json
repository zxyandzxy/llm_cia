In order to help solve the CIA mission, you should first understand some necessary concepts\uff1a\n(1)entity: Entities represent source code files in CIA tasks, and all the CIA tasks under study are based on the Java language, so entities are files with the .java extension.\n(2)starting entity: The starting entity is also called salient entity, and the salient entity is the root change that causes the modification of the rest of entities in a change set, while the rest of entities are the dependency modification along with the salient one.\nYou will be presented with a starting entity and tools (functions) will be provided to access the more information of the origin system. Your task is to gradually explain which entity really need to be synchronized, based on the starting entity and the information obtained through the function-call. You have 7 chances to call the function to get more information."

This confirms that although there are no direct structural dependencies between these two files, they share a significant amount of **semantic similarity** in their code.\n\nThis explains the high co-change confidence (0.346) observed earlier \u2014 changes in one are likely to affect the other due to shared functionality or design patterns.\n\n### Final Assessment:\nBased on all the analyses performed:\n\n#### Entities that should be synchronized with changes to `MTable.java`:\n1. **StyleSupport.java**\n   - Direct call graph dependency.\n   - High conceptual coupling (0.8018).\n\n2. **TaskTable.java**\n   - High co-change confidence (0.346).\n   - Very high conceptual coupling (0.8589).\n\n3. **TodoEditorCore.java**\n   - High co-change confidence (0.2307).\n   - Potential for similar functional impact.\n\n4. **TodoEditor.java**\n   - High co-change confidence (0.2307).\n   - Likely shares similar logic or usage scenarios.\n\n5. **ColumnManager.java**\n   - Moderate co-change confidence (0.1538).\n   - May still need review due to historical correlation.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendation:\nTo ensure consistency and avoid regression issues:\n- Review and synchronize changes in `StyleSupport.java` and `TaskTable.java` as top priorities.\n- Investigate changes in `TodoEditorCore.java` and `TodoEditor.java` for any necessary updates.\n- Monitor `ColumnManager.java` for indirect impacts.\n\nWould you like me to retrieve the original source code of any of these entities for deeper inspection?",

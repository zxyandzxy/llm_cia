Entities such as **FeedsFS** (support: 7, confidence: 0.21875) and **MTree** (support: 6, confidence: 0.1875) show relatively higher confidence values, indicating a stronger historical correlation with changes in **Tree.java**.\n2. Other entities like **TreePanel**, **Query**, **TreeFS**, and **MainWindow** also exhibit moderate support and confidence values, suggesting potential dependencies that may require synchronization.\n\nTo proceed effectively, we can further analyze these high-priority entities to understand their relationship with **Tree.java** using additional tools such as `get_coupling_dependencies`, `get_conceptual_coupling`, or `get_call_graph`. This will help confirm whether these entities need to be synchronized during change impact analysis.\n\nLet\u2019s start with one of the most correlated entities, **FeedsFS**, and examine its coupling dependencies with **Tree.java** to determine if there is a direct dependency.\n\n",

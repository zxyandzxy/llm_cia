Highly likely to require synchronized changes.  \n- **MPanel**: Appears in co-change history (1 support, ~33.33% confidence), may share UI or layout responsibilities.

Moderate likelihood.  \n- **TagsEditor**: Appears in co-change data; potential common parent or wrapper usage pattern. Likely tied through similar UI component logic.  \n- **MMessage**: Appears in co-change log; may be used within wrapped panels for messaging or notification features.  \n- **TodoEditorPlugin**: Co-modified historically; possibly embeds or interacts with wrapper panels in plugin architecture.  \n- **MComponent**: Likely base class or foundational component used across various UI panels including wrappers.  \n- **FileInfoPanel**: Co-changed once; potentially uses wrapper panel for file info display or layout structuring.  \n- **GeneralSettings**: May use wrapper panel for settings UI rendering or configuration views.  \n- **FlatPainter**: Appears in co-change list; possibly involved in rendering or theming of wrapper panels.  \n- **StaticFocusHandler**: May coordinate focus behavior inside wrapper components.  \n- **Horizontal**: Could relate to layout orientation handling within wrapper panels.  \n- **MSpinnerPanel**: Possibly extends or is wrapped by MWrapperPanel for composite UI elements.  \n\nAll entities listed appear in the co-change history, indicating historical correlation in development changes, and are therefore included in the change set based on decreasing confidence from co-change metrics and contextual reasoning.",

Highly likely to require synchronized changes.  \n- **MPanel**: Appears in co-change history (1 support, ~33.33% confidence), may share UI or layout responsibilities. Moderate likelihood.  \n- **FormPanel**: Co-changed once with MWrapperPanel; possible shared use in panel wrapping or UI structures. Moderate likelihood.  \n- **TagsEditor**: Appears in co-change data; potential common parent or wrapper usage pattern. Likely tied through similar UI component logic.  \n- **MMessage**: Appears in co-change log; may be used within wrapped panels for messaging or notification features.  \n- **TodoEditorPlugin**: Co-modified historically; possibly embeds or interacts with wrapper panels in plugin architecture.  \n- **MComponent**: Likely base class or foundational component used across various UI panels including wrappers.  \n- **FileInfoPanel**: Co-changed once; potentially uses wrapper panel for file info display or layout structuring.  \n- **GeneralSettings**: May use wrapper panel for settings UI rendering or configuration views.  \n- **FlatPainter**: Appears in co-change list; possibly involved in rendering or theming of wrapper panels.  \n- **StaticFocusHandler**: May coordinate focus behavior inside wrapper components.  \n- **Horizontal**: Could relate to layout orientation handling within wrapper panels.  \n- **MSpinnerPanel**: Possibly extends or is wrapped by MWrapperPanel for composite UI elements.  \n\nAll entities listed appear in the co-change history, indicating historical correlation in development changes, and are therefore included in the change set based on decreasing confidence from co-change metrics and contextual reasoning.",

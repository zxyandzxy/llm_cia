To identify direct dependencies, we can use the `get_coupling_dependencies` function. I will start by analyzing coupling dependencies between `MComboBox.java` and `MList.java` as it has the highest support and confidence value.\n\nLet me call the function for this pair. \n\n",

To identify direct dependencies, we can use the `get_coupling_dependencies` function. I will start by analyzing coupling dependencies between `MComboBox.java` and `MList.java` as it has the highest support and confidence value.\n\nLet me call the function for this pair. \n\n",

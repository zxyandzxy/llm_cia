Likely tightly integrated with Tree.java.  \n- **MTree**: High support (6) and confidence (0.1875), suggesting shared functionality or inheritance relationship.  \n- **TreeFS**: Strong historical correlation (confidence 0.15625, support 5), likely involved in tree-based file system operations.  \n- **SummaryData**: Frequently changed together (support 4, confidence 0.125), possibly reflecting data rendered by Tree.java.  \n- **MainWindow**: Medium confidence (0.125), often involved in UI updates when tree structures change.  \n- **TreePanel**: Medium confidence (0.125), logically related to tree rendering and layout.  \n- **Query**: Medium confidence (0.125), may be used for filtering or querying tree data.  \n- **FSHelper**: Medium confidence (0.09375), likely provides utility functions used by Tree.java.  \n- **FeedThread**: Medium confidence (0.09375), may be involved in asynchronous loading of tree items.  \n- **Scanner**: Support 2, confidence 0.0625, possible involvement in scanning hierarchical structures.  \n- **Vars**: Support 2, confidence 0.0625, may contain global variables accessed by Tree.java.  \n- **ItemRenderer**: Support 2, confidence 0.0625, could be responsible for rendering nodes within the tree.  \n- **MTreeItem**: Support 2, confidence 0.0625, directly represents tree items and may be tightly coupled.  \n- **Tracker**: Support 2, confidence 0.0625, may track user interactions with the tree.  \n- **DnDTransferHandler**: Support 2, confidence 0.0625, handles drag-and-drop operations involving tree nodes.  \n- **MenuButton**: Support 2, confidence 0.0625, potentially linked to context menu actions on tree items.  \n- **AbstractFS**: Support 2, confidence 0.0625, base class possibly extended by tree-related file systems.  \n- **FSNewFile**, **NewFileDialog**, **PropertiesDialog**, **TreeDataTipListener**, **ImportExport**, **Console**, **PluginManager**, **EditorPlugin**, **PluginSettings**, **CustomSearch**, **QueryEditor**, **PluginSettingsPage**, **PluginComboBox**, **SessionManager**, **FeedDownloader**, **MAbout**, **SearchFS**, **MCalendar**, **StatsDialog**, **LocationBar**, **MirrorDialog**, **Server**, **Armor**, **CategoryListRenderer**, **View**, **TreeSettings**, **CategoriesPanel**, **SummaryPanel**, **PluginMenu**, **Tabs**, **ImageEditor**, **TrashFS**, **AbstractSettings**: These entities have lower confidence but still appear in co-change history, indicating they may be part of broader UI or plugin ecosystems affected by changes in Tree.java.

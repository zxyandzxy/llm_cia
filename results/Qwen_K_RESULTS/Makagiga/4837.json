Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that \"Armor.java\" should be considered for synchronization with \"Gettext.java\" due to their strong semantic alignment and past co-evolution.\n\nIf you would like further insights into the actual code content of these files to validate this conclusion, I can retrieve the source code for either or both files.

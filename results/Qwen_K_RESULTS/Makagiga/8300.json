I recommend analyzing the coupling relationships between `MColor.java` and these high-confidence files to understand the potential dependencies. Let's start by checking the coupling dependencies between `MColor.java` and `HTMLColorChooserPanel.java`.\n\nWould you like me to proceed with this?",

Please note that in order to ensure recall, you need to give as many entities as possible (preferably more than 40) that need to be modified synchronously based on your analysis, where the result of the function get_co_change_relationship should be used as an important reference.

Entities such as `HTMLColorChooserPanel` and `MColorChooserDialog` show the highest confidence (0.2727), indicating strong historical correlation with `MColor.java`. Others like `SessionManager`, `BrushTypeAction`, and `CategoryListRenderer` also exhibit moderate confidence (~0.18). While many others have low confidence (~0.09), they still represent potential synchronization needs based on past developer behavior, hence included to ensure high recall. To further refine this list, coupling and semantic dependencies could be analyzed, but within the scope of this task and given the constraints, this change set represents a comprehensive list of candidates for synchronized modification.",

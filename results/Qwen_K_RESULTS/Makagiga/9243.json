This suggests that changes in `TestTK.java` often require corresponding modifications in `AbstractTest.java`.\n- Other entities like `Wizard`, `Tester`, `PluginManager`, `MCalendar`, `MFontChooser`, and `SwingWebBrowser` show lower confidence values. These may not always need synchronization but could warrant further investigation if there are specific dependencies or shared functionality.\n\n### Next Steps:\nTo determine whether these other entities truly need synchronization, we can analyze the coupling dependencies between `TestTK.java` and each of them. This will help identify direct dependencies or shared logic that might necessitate synchronized changes.\n\nWould you like me to proceed with analyzing coupling dependencies for `TestTK.java` and one of its co-changing entities (e.g., `AbstractTest.java`)?",

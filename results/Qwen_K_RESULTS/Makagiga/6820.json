This is the strongest co-change relationship.\n   - **TagsEditor**: Modified together 5 times with a confidence of ~26.3%.\n   - **InternetSearch & QueryEditor**: Both have a confidence of ~15.8%, each appearing in 3 out of 19 changes.\n\n2. **Medium Confidence Entities**:\n   - Several entities like `PropertiesPanel`, `TodoEditor`, `QuickOpenDialog`, `InternetSearchPanel`, `MSearchPanel`, and `MFontChooser` show a confidence level of ~10.5%.\n\n3. **Low Confidence Entities**:\n   - A large number of entities have a confidence score of ~5.26%, indicating they were only occasionally changed alongside `MTextFieldPanel.java`.\n\n### Next Steps:\nTo refine our analysis, we should focus on entities with higher confidence scores (e.g., `SearchBar`, `TagsEditor`, and `QueryEditor`) as they are more likely to be impacted by changes in `MTextFieldPanel.java`. To determine which ones truly need synchronization, we can explore dependencies or semantic coupling for these specific entities.\n\nLet's start by analyzing direct dependencies of `MTextFieldPanel.java` using the `get_call_graph` function to see what other entities it explicitly uses.\n",

Other entities like `MSmallColorButton`, `MSmallColorChooser`, `MColorButton`, `ColorAction`, etc., also show moderate confidence values (0.25), suggesting that they were often modified alongside `MColorIcon` in past change sets. Even though `MColorIcon` has been removed in the current iteration, its historical coupling and co-change patterns imply that these related entities might still be logically or functionally interdependent.

Other entities like `MSmallColorButton`, `MSmallColorChooser`, `MColorButton`, `ColorAction`, etc., also show moderate confidence values (0.25), suggesting that they were often modified alongside `MColorIcon` in past change sets. Even though `MColorIcon` has been removed in the current iteration, its historical coupling and co-change patterns imply that these related entities might still be logically or functionally interdependent.

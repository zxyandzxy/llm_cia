This suggests that, while there may not be a direct structural dependency, the two entities share similar functionalities or purposes within the application.\n\nGiven this information:\n\n- **ActionGroup** appears to be functionally related to `ProxyPanel.java`, as indicated by both the co-change analysis (100% confidence) and the high conceptual coupling score (~85% similarity).\n- **Table** has been removed from the project and no longer needs to be considered for synchronization.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe entity that likely needs to be synchronized with changes in `ProxyPanel.java` is **ActionGroup**, due to its strong co-change history and significant semantic similarity.\n\nIf you need further insight into how these files might interact semantically, I can retrieve and analyze the source code of `ProxyPanel.java`.

Additionally, the conceptual coupling score is approximately 0.8495, showing a high semantic similarity. These factors suggest that changes in `ProxyPanel.java` are very likely to require synchronization with `ActionGroup`.  \n\n2. **Table**: Although this entity has been removed from the project due to version iteration, it still appeared in all modification records alongside `ProxyPanel.java`. This perfect co-change confidence (100%) suggests that historically, this entity was strongly linked with `ProxyPanel.java`.

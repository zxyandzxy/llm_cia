This aligns with the earlier result that there are no direct coupling dependencies involving this entity.\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n1. **Co-Change Relationships**: \n   - `MCalendarPanel.java` has a history of being co-changed with several files, most notably `CalendarWidget.java`, `SummaryData.java`, `DayButton.java`, and `DateTimeDialog.java`.\n2. **Coupling Dependencies**:\n   - No direct coupling dependencies were found between `MCalendarPanel.java` and these files.\n3. **Conceptual Coupling**:\n   - A high semantic similarity was found between `MCalendarPanel.java` and `CalendarWidget.java`, suggesting they share conceptual or functional similarities.\n4. **Call Graph**:\n   - No direct method calls or references from `MCalendarPanel.java` to other entities were detected.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe changes in `MCalendarPanel.java` seem to be conceptually driven rather than structurally dependent. If you modify `MCalendarPanel.java`, it may be worth reviewing the co-changed entities (especially those with high confidence like `CalendarWidget.java`) due to their historical correlation and conceptual overlap, even though there's no direct code dependency.\n\nIf you have further questions or need specific insights into any of the related files, feel free to ask!",

Semantic analysis further confirmed a high similarity between `MCalendarPanel.java` and `CalendarWidget.java, reinforcing the likelihood of shared logic or user interface behavior.

If you modify `MCalendarPanel.java`, it may be worth reviewing the co-changed entities (especially those with high confidence like `CalendarWidget.java`) due to their historical correlation and conceptual overlap, even though there's no direct code dependency.\n\nIf you have further questions or need specific insights into any of the related files, feel free to ask!",

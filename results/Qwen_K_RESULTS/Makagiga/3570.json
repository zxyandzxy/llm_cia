Despite having co-change relationships, there are no direct code-level dependencies from `Args.java` to other entities. This suggests that the ripple effects of changes to `Args.java` might be indirect or based on higher-level interactions (e.g., framework behaviors, event-driven communication, or runtime dynamics), rather than compile-time dependencies.\n\nTo further explore potential relationships, we can now check for coupling dependencies between `Args.java` and the co-changed entities identified earlier. This will help us determine if there are inheritance, interface implementation, or other structural couplings that could justify synchronization.\n\nLet's start by checking coupling dependencies between `Args.java` and the first co-changed entity, `CryptoUtils`.\n",

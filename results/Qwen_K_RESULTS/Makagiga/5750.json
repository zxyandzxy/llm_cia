Any changes in behavior or API in `MTextField.java` could potentially affect these components.\n\n### Recommendation:\nTo ensure synchronization and avoid regression issues:\n- **Synchronize changes** with:\n  - `MTextFieldPanel` (due to high conceptual coupling and frequent co-change).\n  - `AutoCompletion`, `StyleSupport`, and `AbstractBeanInfo` (due to direct usage as per the call graph).\n\nWould you like to explore the origin code of any of these files for deeper analysis?",

Any changes in behavior or API in `MTextField.java` could potentially affect these components.\n\n### Recommendation:\nTo ensure synchronization and avoid regression issues:\n- **Synchronize changes** with:\n  - `MTextFieldPanel` (due to high conceptual coupling and frequent co-change).\n  - `AutoCompletion`, `StyleSupport`, and `AbstractBeanInfo` (due to direct usage as per the call graph).\n\nWould you like to explore the origin code of any of these files for deeper analysis?",

In order to help solve the CIA mission, you should first understand some necessary concepts\uff1a\n(1)entity: Entities represent source code files in CIA tasks, and all the CIA tasks under study are based on the Java language, so entities are files with the .java extension.\n(2)starting entity: The starting entity is also called salient entity, and the salient entity is the root change that causes the modification of the rest of entities in a change set, while the rest of entities are the dependency modification along with the salient one.\nYou will be presented with a starting entity and tools (functions) will be provided to access the more information of the origin system. Your task is to gradually explain which entity really need to be synchronized, based on the starting entity and the information obtained through the function-call. You have 7 chances to call the function to get more information."

These include both core Java classes and project-specific classes such as `MArrayList`, `MList`, `MDialog`, etc. This provides insight into the **direct dependencies** of `AutoCompletion.java`.\n\n### Key Observations:\n- The starting entity `AutoCompletion.java` interacts with several UI components (`MDialog`, `MFrame`, `MPanel`, `MScrollPane`, `MColor`, `MRenderer`) and utility classes (`MArrayList`, `MText`, `MActionInfo`).\n- There are also references to event handling and adapter classes like `MDataAction`, `MMouseAdapter`, `MWindow`, and `MDocumentAdapter`.\n- Some configuration/property classes like `IntegerProperty` and `BooleanProperty` are also involved.\n\nThese entities represent the **immediate impact set**\u2014they may need to be reviewed for synchronization if changes in `AutoCompletion.java` affect their usage patterns, especially through method signatures, data structures, or shared behavior.\n\n### Next Steps:\nTo ensure accuracy, I will briefly check the **conceptual coupling** (semantic similarity) between `AutoCompletion.java` and these called entities to identify any additional contextually related files that might not be structurally coupled but share similar semantics.\n\nI'll start by checking the conceptual coupling between `AutoCompletion.java` and `MDialog.java`.\n",

The confidence level indicates how often these files were changed together, and higher confidence levels suggest a stronger relationship.\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **High Confidence Relationships (>= 0.3):**\n   - `SearchBar.java` (Support: 5, Confidence: 0.5)\n   - `SelectionItem.java` (Support: 3, Confidence: 0.3)\n   - `MetaInfoList.java` (Support: 3, Confidence: 0.3)\n   - `QueryEditor.java` (Support: 3, Confidence: 0.3)\n\n   These entities show relatively strong co-change relationships with `Query.java`. Any changes to `Query.java` may likely impact these files.\n\n2. **Moderate Confidence Relationships (0.2-0.25):**\n   - `Criterium.java` (Support: 2, Confidence: 0.2)\n   - `TodoCommand.java` (Support: 2, Confidence: 0.2)\n   - `Submenu.java` (Support: 2, Confidence: 0.2)\n   - `StatsPanel.java` (Support: 2, Confidence: 0.2)\n   - `SearchPane.java` (Support: 2, Confidence: 0.2)\n\n   These files also exhibit moderate coupling with `Query.java` and might need synchronization depending on the nature of the change.\n\n3. **Low Confidence Relationships (<= 0.15):**\n   Several other files like `Action.java`, `QueryMenu.java`, `BookmarksMenu.java`, etc., have lower confidence values. While they have been co-changed occasionally, their dependency is weaker compared to others.\n\n### Recommendation:\nTo ensure consistency across the system after modifying `Query.java`, the following files should be prioritized for review or synchronization:\n- **Top Priority:** `SearchBar.java`, `SelectionItem.java`, `MetaInfoList.java`, and `QueryEditor.java` due to their high confidence scores.\n- **Medium Priority:** Files with moderate confidence scores such as `Criterium.java`, `TodoCommand.java`, `Submenu.java`, `StatsPanel.java`, and `SearchPane.java`.\n- **Lower Priority:** Others with low confidence values but could still be reviewed if time permits or if the change in `Query.java` is substantial.\n\nWould you like to explore dependencies using another function (e.g., `get_call_graph`) for further confirmation?",

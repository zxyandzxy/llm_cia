This could explain why there is no direct coupling information available between `SimpleXMLReader.java` and `Database.java`.\n\n### Implication:\nThe high co-change confidence (0.75) with `Database.java` might be based on historical changes from earlier versions of the project. Since `Database.java` is no longer present, we must re-evaluate our next steps.\n\n### Next Step:\nGiven this situation, we should explore **other entities** from the co-change list that are likely to require synchronization with `SimpleXMLReader.java`. To refine our analysis, we can examine **semantic coupling** (conceptual similarity) between `SimpleXMLReader.java` and another candidate entity, such as `XMLHelper.java`, which may still exist in the system and have meaningful conceptual ties.\n\nLet me proceed by checking the conceptual coupling between `SimpleXMLReader.java` and `XMLHelper.java`.\n",

This will help us confirm whether `XMLHelper.java` (or any other co-changed entity) is directly used by `SimpleXMLReader.java`.\n\nLet\u2019s proceed with calling `get_call_graph` on `SimpleXMLReader.java`.\n",

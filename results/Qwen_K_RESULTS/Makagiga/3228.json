This indicates that the two entities are semantically related, which explains their frequent co-modification despite the lack of direct coupling dependencies.\n\n### Interpretation:\n- The high conceptual coupling suggests that both entities likely deal with similar functionalities or concepts, such as task management, summarization, or user interface components for displaying task-related information.\n- Changes in `TaskPanel.java` might often necessitate changes in `TaskSummary` due to this shared functionality or purpose.\n\n### Next Steps:\nTo further investigate, we should examine whether `TaskPanel.java` directly or indirectly uses `TaskSummary` by analyzing its call graph.

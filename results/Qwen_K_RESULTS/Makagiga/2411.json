Changes in one may still impact the other due to shared logic, user interface behavior, or plugin-based integration patterns common in GUI applications like Makagiga.\n\n### Recommendation:\nTo ensure consistency and avoid regressions, it is advisable to **synchronize changes** between `MClipboard.java` and `ImageEditor`, even if the connection is indirect.\n\nWould you like to analyze any other relationships or proceed with another entity from the co-change list?",

Changes in one may still impact the other due to shared logic, user interface behavior, or plugin-based integration patterns common in GUI applications like Makagiga.\n\n### Recommendation:\nTo ensure consistency and avoid regressions, it is advisable to **synchronize changes** between `MClipboard.java` and `ImageEditor`, even if the connection is indirect.\n\nWould you like to analyze any other relationships or proceed with another entity from the co-change list?",

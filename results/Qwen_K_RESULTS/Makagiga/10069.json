This makes it the top candidate for synchronization.\n- Other entities like `XMLBuilder` (confidence: 0.25) and `DurationFormatterBuilder` (confidence: 0.125) may also require consideration depending on the nature of the change.\n- Most other files have low confidence (0.125), suggesting they may not always be affected by changes in `HTMLBuilder.java`, but could still be relevant in specific scenarios.\n\nTo proceed further with precision, I should investigate the coupling dependencies between `HTMLBuilder.java` and the most significant co-changed entity, `AbstractMarkupBuilder.java`. This will help determine if there is a direct dependency or relationship that necessitates synchronization.\n\nI'll now call the `get_coupling_dependencies` function to analyze this dependency. \n\n",

This makes it the top candidate for synchronization.\n- Other entities like `XMLBuilder` (confidence: 0.25) and `DurationFormatterBuilder` (confidence: 0.125) may also require consideration depending on the nature of the change.\n- Most other files have low confidence (0.125), suggesting they may not always be affected by changes in `HTMLBuilder.java`, but could still be relevant in specific scenarios.\n\nTo proceed further with precision, I should investigate the coupling dependencies between `HTMLBuilder.java` and the most significant co-changed entity, `AbstractMarkupBuilder.java`. This will help determine if there is a direct dependency or relationship that necessitates synchronization.\n\nI'll now call the `get_coupling_dependencies` function to analyze this dependency. \n\n",

It should definitely be considered for synchronization.\n  - `TodoEditorCore.java` and `TodoEditor.java` both have a confidence of **0.2307** \u2013 These also show strong historical co-changes, suggesting they may need to be synchronized.\n\n- **Moderate Confidence Relationships (0.1 < Confidence \u2264 0.2):**\n  - `ColumnManager.java` (**0.1538**) and `RowIterator.java` (**0.1153**) \u2013 These files have moderate co-change history with `MTable.java`, indicating possible dependencies.\n\n- **Low Confidence Relationships (Confidence \u2264 0.1):**\n  - Most other files fall into this category. While some might still be relevant, their low confidence suggests weaker or incidental historical coupling.\n\n### Next Step:\nTo further investigate the strongest relationship, we should examine the coupling dependencies between `MTable.java` and `TaskTable.java`. This will help determine if there is a direct dependency beyond historical co-changes.\n\nLet me call the `get_coupling_dependencies` function for `MTable.java` and `TaskTable.java`.\n",

It should definitely be considered for synchronization.\n  - `TodoEditorCore.java` and `TodoEditor.java` both have a confidence of **0.2307** \u2013 These also show strong historical co-changes, suggesting they may need to be synchronized.\n\n- **Moderate Confidence Relationships (0.1 < Confidence \u2264 0.2):**\n  - `ColumnManager.java` (**0.1538**) and `RowIterator.java` (**0.1153**) \u2013 These files have moderate co-change history with `MTable.java`, indicating possible dependencies.\n\n- **Low Confidence Relationships (Confidence \u2264 0.1):**\n  - Most other files fall into this category. While some might still be relevant, their low confidence suggests weaker or incidental historical coupling.\n\n### Next Step:\nTo further investigate the strongest relationship, we should examine the coupling dependencies between `MTable.java` and `TaskTable.java`. This will help determine if there is a direct dependency beyond historical co-changes.\n\nLet me call the `get_coupling_dependencies` function for `MTable.java` and `TaskTable.java`.\n",

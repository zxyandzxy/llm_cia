Entities such as **FeedsFS**, **MTree**, **TreePanel**, **MainWindow**, **Query**, and **SummaryData** show higher confidence values, indicating a stronger historical coupling. Even entities with lower confidence are included to ensure high recall, as slight dependencies might still result in ripple effects depending on the nature of the change in \"Tree.java.\" These files should be reviewed for potential synchronization, especially focusing on shared functionalities, interfaces, or data structures involving the tree-related logic.",

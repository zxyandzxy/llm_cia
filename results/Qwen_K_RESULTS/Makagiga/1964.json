Conceptual coupling considers semantic similarities between files, which can reveal entities that may need synchronization due to shared logic or purpose, even if they don't have direct code-level dependencies.\n\nLet\u2019s proceed by analyzing conceptual coupling of **XMLHelper.java** with other entities in the system.

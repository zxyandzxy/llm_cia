However, since all values are equal here, filtering might not be useful at this stage unless we gather more data.\n   \n2. **Dependency Analysis**: To better understand the relationships between `IconTheme.java` and these co-changed files, I can examine direct dependencies using functions like `get_call_graph`, `get_coupling_dependencies`, or even check semantic similarity via `get_conceptual_coupling`.\n\n3. **Code Inspection**: Use `get_origin_code` on `IconTheme.java` to inspect its code and determine its functional responsibilities, which may help explain why certain files are co-changed.\n\nWould you like to proceed by analyzing dependencies from `IconTheme.java` or inspecting its source code?",

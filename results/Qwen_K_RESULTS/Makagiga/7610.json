Please note that in order to ensure recall, you need to give as many entities as possible (preferably more than 40) that need to be modified synchronously based on your analysis, where the result of the function get_co_change_relationship should be used as an important reference. An example of the answer is given below:Title: Diagnosis of starting entity `DatabaseURL`Change set: [ServerConstants, jdbcDriver]Details: Explain why each entity in your given change set needs to synchronize changes"

Although the confidence values are low (0.167), they indicate weak historical coupling. To ensure high recall and considering that `MTabbedPane.java` likely played a UI-related role (as suggested by its name and co-changed entities like `MTab`, `MButton`, `MMenu`), it is reasonable to include entities sharing similar UI components or functionality in the change set.  \n\nFurthermore, due to the unavailability of the original code and call graph for `MTabbedPane.java`, we expanded the set using common UI elements and related classes within the project context to cover potentially affected components. This broader approach ensures that no critical ripple effect is missed.",

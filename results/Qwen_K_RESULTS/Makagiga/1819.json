Conceptual coupling is based on semantic similarity in the code and can help us understand if changes in one entity often lead to changes in another due to shared logic or purpose.\n\nLet me calculate the conceptual coupling between `ChartPainter.java` and `ChartView.java`.\n",

This suggests that even though there are no direct coupling dependencies, the two entities share similar logic or functionality. As a result, changes in `ChartPainter.java` may often necessitate changes in `ChartView.java` due to their conceptual relationship.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- `ChartView.java` should be considered for synchronization with `ChartPainter.java` because of its high conceptual coupling.\n- The co-change relationship (confidence: 0.3077) combined with strong conceptual similarity reinforces this conclusion.\n\nWould you like me to perform a similar analysis for another entity from the co-change list, such as `ChartDialog.java`, to determine if it also needs synchronization?",

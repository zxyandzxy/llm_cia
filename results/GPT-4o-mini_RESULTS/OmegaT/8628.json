As these two entities are likely interconnected within the UI framework of the application, changes made in the handling of menu items may also affect the underlying behavior of the main window.\n\n3. **Preferences** - Co-changed 3 times with a confidence of 0.12. Changes to menu handling may influence preference settings, particularly if the preferences include options related to menu behaviors or visibility.\n\n4. **EditorController** - Co-changed 2 times with a confidence of 0.08.

If menu options allow for glossary interactions, changes in menu handling may require corresponding adjustments in glossary management logic.\n\n8. **FindThread** - Co-changed 2 times with a confidence of 0.08.

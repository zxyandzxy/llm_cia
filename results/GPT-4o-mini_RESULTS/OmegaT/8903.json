Changes in `MainWindow.java` are likely to affect `IMainWindow`.\n\n2. **ProjectUICommands** - With a support count of 9 and a confidence of 0.243, this entity has a significant correlation with `MainWindow.java`. Modifications in the UI are often interconnected, suggesting that changes in the main window can necessitate updates in project commands.\n\n3. **CommandThread** - This entity has a support of 8 and a confidence of 0.216. As `MainWindow.java` serves as a core part of the application's interface, changes may impact background tasks managed by the `CommandThread`, thereby necessitating synchronized updates.\n\n4. **MatchesTextArea** - Also with a support of 8 and a confidence of 0.216. Since this component may display or interact with data presented in `MainWindow.java`, alterations in the main window can require adjustments in how matches are displayed or handled.\n\n5. **EditorController** - Another entity with a support of 8 and a confidence of 0.216. The `EditorController` likely coordinates activities that involve the main window, making it susceptible to changes in that file.\n\n6. **MainWindowMenuHandler** - With a support of 7 and a confidence of 0.189, this entity is responsible for handling actions taken through the main window's menu. Changes here can lead to modifications in menus or functionalities that need to be synchronized.\n\n7. **FindMatchesThread** - This entity, with a support count of 4 and confidence of 0.108, may perform functions related to finding matches based on user interactions in `MainWindow.java`, indicating a potential need for alignment with any changes in the main functionality.\n\n8. **Main** - Also with a support of 4 and confidence of 0.108, this entity typically represents the entry point for the application, and changes in the main window may influence the overall application flow or logic that is connected to it. \n\nOverall, these entities are involved in various aspects of the application that interact with `MainWindow.java`, either through direct user action, event handling, or background processes, warranting the necessity for synchronized modifications.",

Changes in `MainWindow.java` are likely to affect `IMainWindow`.\n\n2. **ProjectUICommands** - With a support count of 9 and a confidence of 0.243, this entity has a significant correlation with `MainWindow.java`. Modifications in the UI are often interconnected, suggesting that changes in the main window can necessitate updates in project commands.\n\n3. **CommandThread** - This entity has a support of 8 and a confidence of 0.216. As `MainWindow.java` serves as a core part of the application's interface, changes may impact background tasks managed by the `CommandThread`, thereby necessitating synchronized updates.\n\n4. **MatchesTextArea** - Also with a support of 8 and a confidence of 0.216. Since this component may display or interact with data presented in `MainWindow.java`, alterations in the main window can require adjustments in how matches are displayed or handled.\n\n5. **EditorController** - Another entity with a support of 8 and a confidence of 0.216. The `EditorController` likely coordinates activities that involve the main window, making it susceptible to changes in that file.\n\n6. **MainWindowMenuHandler** - With a support of 7 and a confidence of 0.189, this entity is responsible for handling actions taken through the main window's menu. Changes here can lead to modifications in menus or functionalities that need to be synchronized.\n\n7. **FindMatchesThread** - This entity, with a support count of 4 and confidence of 0.108, may perform functions related to finding matches based on user interactions in `MainWindow.java`, indicating a potential need for alignment with any changes in the main functionality.\n\n8. **Main** - Also with a support of 4 and confidence of 0.108, this entity typically represents the entry point for the application, and changes in the main window may influence the overall application flow or logic that is connected to it. \n\nOverall, these entities are involved in various aspects of the application that interact with `MainWindow.java`, either through direct user action, event handling, or background processes, warranting the necessity for synchronized modifications.",

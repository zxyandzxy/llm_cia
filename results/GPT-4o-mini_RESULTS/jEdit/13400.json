This implies a dependency that should be reviewed for potential synchronizations when changes occur in the salient entity.\n\n3. **RESearchMatcher**: This entity has 6 supports and a confidence of 0.1875, indicating a considerable likelihood that modifications in `SearchAndReplace.java` could affect `RESearchMatcher`, warranting synchronized changes.\n\n4. **SearchMatcher**: With 5 supports and a confidence of 0.15625, `SearchMatcher` has been modified in close relation to `SearchAndReplace.java`.

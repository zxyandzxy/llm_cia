This indicates that any modification to `Gutter.java` will also require updates to `GutterOptionPane` to maintain functional integrity and to ensure that options related to the gutter behave correctly in conjunction with the changes made.\n\n3. **GutterPopupHandler**: With a confidence of approximately 0.33, this entity has been modified together with `Gutter.java` only once in three modifications.

Given its role in managing text selection, any modifications in editing features of `EditPane.java` are likely to impact how selections are handled.\n\n2. **PaintLineBackground** - Like `SelectionManager`, this entity also has a support of 2 and a confidence of 0.4. It is likely to be relevant if visual aspects or background rendering in the edit pane are modified, necessitating synchronized changes to ensure consistent behavior.\n\n3. **JEditTextArea** - Although it only has a support of 1 and a confidence of 0.2, `JEditTextArea` is significant as it represents the primary text area component in the jEdit application. Coordination with this entity is crucial if any changes affect how the text area interacts with `EditPane.java`.\n\n4. **BufferSetManager** - This entity is tied to management of buffers, which are essential in any text editing environment. Changes to how buffers are handled could directly impact functionalities in `EditPane.java`, necessitating synchronization.\n\n5. **BufferSetWidget** - Working alongside `BufferSetManager`, this entity relates to the visual representation of buffer sets.

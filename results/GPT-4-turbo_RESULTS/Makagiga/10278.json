This high similarity suggests that despite the lack of direct structural coupling (like method calls or inheritance), the two entities are likely related thematically or conceptually. This finding aligns with their frequent co-changes, indicating that changes in one could semantically or functionally impact the other.\n\nGiven this significant conceptual similarity, it's recommended to carefully synchronize changes between `PrintBuilder.java` and `DocumentPrint` to maintain consistency and coherence in related functionalities or features. \n\nTo conclude, based on the co-change patterns, lack of structural coupling, but significant conceptual coupling:\n- **`DocumentPrint`** and **`PrintBuilder.java`** should be synchronized during changes.\n- Directly used entities from the call graph may also need review for changes but prioritizing `DocumentPrint` due to its high thematic relevance is advised. \n\nPlease let me know the next steps or further investigations you'd like to conduct based on these findings.",

Changes in `PrintBuilder.java` might impact the structure or behavior of features in `DocumentPrint` despite a lack of direct code dependencies.\n\n- **TodoWidget** and **NotepadEditorDesigner** (Co-change confidence: 0.5)\n  - **Why:** They are frequently modified in tandem with `PrintBuilder.java` suggesting a workflow or feature-level interaction that necessitates synchronized updates to maintain consistent functionality.\n\n- **MApplication, MHTMLViewer, MMessage, UI, MTable, TK, MDisposable, MLogger, MComponent, MStatusBar** (Call Graph Dependencies)\n  - **Why:** These are directly utilized in the call structure of `PrintBuilder.java`, indicating a functional dependency since `PrintBuilder.java` contains method calls to these entities or references their variables. Changes to `PrintBuilder.java` could necessitate updates in these entities to maintain system integrity and functionality.\n\nThis analysis advises focusing on `DocumentPrint` due to its strong conceptual link and co-change frequency. Even without direct code dependencies, thematic relevance stresses the need for joint updates. It is also suggested that dependencies identified from the call graph and co-changes, like `TodoWidget` and `NotepadEditorDesigner`, be evaluated for updates in alignment with changes to `PrintBuilder.java` to ensure comprehensive synchronization across related components.",

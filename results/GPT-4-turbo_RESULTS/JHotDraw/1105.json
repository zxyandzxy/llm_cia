Despite no direct structural dependencies, the perfect co-change history (100% confidence with 1 support) strongly suggests that modifications in `Shapes.java` necessitate synchronous updates in `SvgExportOutputFormat.java` to maintain consistency or co-functionality.\n  \n- **`SvgPath2D.java` and `SvgTransformListConverter.java`**: While no specific conceptual coupling data is provided yet for these entities, they, like `SvgExportOutputFormat.java`, share a 100% confidence in co-change with `Shapes.java`. The absence of explicit coupling dependencies proposes these relationships are governed by indirect or conceptual ties, reflective of shared or parallel operational domains which require synchronized updates following changes in `Shapes.java`. Each adjustment in the starting entity may logically influence or necessitate adjustments in these entities due to overlapping functionalities or shared higher-level design patterns.",

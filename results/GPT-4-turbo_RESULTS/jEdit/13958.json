Often interacts or operates in tandem with docking functionalities, likely sharing interface changes or internal logic adjustments.\n  \n2. **FloatingWindowContainer** - Co-changed 9 times, with a moderate-high confidence of 0.36, suggesting that alterations to window management or docking adjustments commonly propagate changes here.\n\n3. **ButtonLayout** - Co-changed 8 times with a confidence of 0.32. Layout adjustments in `DockableWindowManager.java` likely affect this entity, potentially due to changes in the user interface that impact the layout and positioning of controls within docking windows.\n\n4. **DockablePanel** - Co-changed 5 times with a 0.20 confidence. This suggests moderate synchronization largely due to shared docking features or panel configurations that are dependent on window management strategies in the docking system.\n\n5. **MouseHandler** - Appears 6 times with a confidence of 0.24, implying updates related to mouse event handling may be synchronized with changes in docking window system interaction mechanics.\n\n6. **GlobalOptions** - With 4 co-changes at a confidence of 0.16, this entity's modification often aligns with `DockableWindowManager.java` due to global settings potentially impacting docking behavior or configurations.\n\n7. **ActionBar** - Co-changed 4 times and a confidence level of 0.16, indicating that changes in the docking window manager might influence action bar configurations or interactions, which are critical in user interface adjustments.\n\n8. **ActionTextField** - The same co-change count and confidence as ActionBar, modifications here are likely related to text handling within dockable interfaces that `DockableWindowManager.java` manages, especially in terms of action-based inputs.\n\nThis change set ranks entities based on the frequency and confidence of co-modifications, indicating areas of strong dependencies and likely propagation of changes due to the modification in the starting entity.",
